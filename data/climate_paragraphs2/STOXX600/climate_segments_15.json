The simple  reason is that we have competencies and long history of water, and we see that demand is increasing  significantly in coming 20 years, 50% and there will be a major gap of 40% between demand and supply in 2030.

First, let's say the three good things  that we faced in our quarter three was really our EBIT margin reaching 8.2%; that was the highest that we have  witnessed during this water chemistry strategy, what we have been running now basically four years. The Fit for  Growth savings that you heard, they came in \u20ac3 million in quarter three. That was a good achievement within a  very short period.

There was a \u2013 in North America, there was a titanium dioxide plant from  which we were getting large quantities of byproducts that we used to sell as coagulant to our customers. That  titanium dioxide plant was closed and we had to sort of reorganize our production streams, meaning that we had  to source new raw materials to manufacture coagulant.

Can we make it more affordable? So sourcing is critical there. How do we really exploit multi-channel? And  increasingly this sort of phrase, not so much multi-channel as omni-channel, how do we be available to our  customers whichever way they want to shop? And how do we provide advice? Because it's clear that actually  people would like to do more but they don't know how. So, the DIY classes and we've had over 20,000 people  through in the U.K. How do we then do that online through YouTube channels? All sorts of ideas about that. And  de-mystifying eco. There's a huge opportunity coming in the eco refurb market. But it's very complicated for  consumers to figure it out. So what can we do to do it?"

The first quarter by principle was a good time for KGHM  Group. On the year-to-year basis we see some decline in payable copper production by 3%, and this is because  of the lower production of KGHM International, especially at the Robinson site. Year-on-year production at  Robinson was down by 4.7%, almost 5,000 tones that led to the lower total payable copper production. So  consequently, the sales of payable copper is down by 2%.

That we have \u2013  we measure two ways. We measure, first of all, the carbon footprint from our own operations. Here, we have a  target of reducing our carbon footprint relative to sales by 3% per annum. That we have done consistently. Last  year, we improved it by 4% if you look at overall operations.

First of all, this hoisting  technology enables now single elevator rides that go up to 1 kilometer. It is quite obvious that there will not be a  huge number of buildings that will be so high or even \u2013 even close \u2013 close to that level. But for the \u2013 for  considering the business, the big thing is that with this technology, we have got a very strong competitive strength  in all buildings that are 150 meters or higher. These include lower energy consumption, lower space requirements,  longer lifetimes, lower lifetime costs, faster installation, and also lower sensitive to building s way in high  buildings. And this, of course, is significant, because number of \u2013 these kind of opportunities is quite significant  both in the new equipment markets as well as in the case of modernization markets."

Again here, we were able to report similar margins in 2009 than in 2008 that  was of course very high margins in the first quarter or second quarter and the lowest margin ever in  Q4 of 2009.

DSOs, I think we have been able to defend, if  you like, to work very well with the customers to have different solutions in place, not to have much longer  extended payment terms, but on the DPO side, very clearly two components that were driving a higher \u2013 or  shorter DPOs by around 7.5 days. One is the over-proportional growth compared to sea and airfreight of contract  logistics, which leads to receivables, but no payables other than if you consider payroll as a payable.

During project execution, the typical deliveries from KOGT are structures  and systems for subsea riser, pipeline products and some process engineering.

Any  of the products related to effluent treatment are largely new-build linked. So in the UK and Ireland,  they have been reasonably depressed actually for the last couple of years and that was still the  case in the first half. There was some growth in the Hot Water side and in Solar indeed in the UK,  which is largely related to the resumption of growth in the new-build housing where that product is  most focused. And Solar, as a general concept, is something that\u2019s certainly been on the rise in the  UK, not just in Solar Thermal but also in Solar Photovoltaics, which we\u2019re seeing in our insulated  panels business.

If you look at building codes heading out to 2016 by some of the key markets  that we\u2019re operating in.

So if you can just imagine that  thickness of insulation up in your roof, which is probably positive for their industry.

And I suppose the  March and April sales pattern will be in key in terms of future indications for the year ahead."

On the left hand side of this chart, you can see the typical  cost per square foot of occupying a building built in the 1980s or 1990s, having been through at least one rent  review cycle, made up of rent in blue, rates in green, and service charges and hard and soft facilities management  costs in brown. Probably around \u00a3118 per square foot all-in based on a rent of \u00a355 per square foot. Today, at 20  Fenchurch Street for example, assuming a headline rent of \u00a365 per square foot, an all-in cost could well be  nudging \u00a3127 a square foot, an increase of around 7%."

The development of staff costs perfectly shows the high  potential for synergies from acquisitions in core markets."

We currently anticipate annual costs of between \u20ac150 million and \u20ac350 million  depending on the certificate price.

Excluding fuel, operating costs would have risen by 0.8% only, far less than the revenue  growth. And we have reached this good performance despite higher fees and charges."

They capitalize on the trend for vintage-style bulbs, which  we see everywhere, and they come in very classic shapes and they command premium, which, of course, is great  for our pricing and profitability. They use the latest LED technology and they are around 80% more energy- efficient than a conventional light bulb and they last 10 times longer."

The market experts expect  for the harvest season 2015, 2016, that's the current one, cocoa deficits being higher than 200,000 tons, some go  up to 300,000 tons even, what would bring the stock-to-use ratio at the end of the period to low 36%. Reasons for  the low harvest outlook is the climate where the El Ni\u00f1o effect led to less rainfall in West Africa in the last winter  and spring. But the markets already look into the next crop season where fundamentals so far look good. That is  as well the reason that you could see in the future's prices over the last 10 days some liquidation of long positions  that led to lower market quotations. The future outlook nevertheless depends on the positioning of speculative  market participants, holding still a future long position reflecting 25% of the total world harvest. One reason as  well, we have to look at one factor, you have to look at for the next 2017 business year is to further develop [ph]  enough (16:15) cocoa butter."

So if you want to  make an Apple tap, you need to add back 2 percentage points. Therefore, 7% this year compared to 8% last year,  pretty much the same growth. And now we are growing from, of course, a higher volume. So the base increases  every year. So keeping to that 5%, 6%, 7% is tough for every year because you're adding more business. But  when we talk to American colleagues and especially then Lars Blecko, who will step in for an interim period as the  CEO, you will meet him next quarter, most likely, and he's very confident on this. And this was probably the  toughest question he and I had. Since I'm leaving the company, I need to feel, are we still on track for the 2017  number? And he said yes to that question.

As you have been reading in the paper, listening to  the news, there's been quite a lot of flooding going on in U.S., in Texas, in Florida, but especially in Puerto Rico.  So, we have been spending a lot of time repairing, replacing damaged safes, and that's been the focus. And also,  on top of that, I mean, the customers are very much focused on sort of getting it back in order, and that they don't  want to discuss sort of new contracts, anything like that. So, there is a delay also due to that fact. But we have a  good pipeline still. We have a backlog that should be installed. I expect a good Q4, and we have [ph] major  (05:52) lots of requests from our customers.

And you\u2019re looking here at the French case study, but obviously this is not the French  situation. This is throughout the world. So what we are estimating and this is shared with many  other players in this environment is that there will be by 2020, which is just nine years from today  but not so far away, 4 billion private charging stations which is typically the work of our trade  channel to be installed by the electricians, to be distributed by distributors and to be supplied by  players like Legrand, four million private charging stations to be installed in order to cope with the  ambition, which I believe will effectively occur of two million electric vehicles by 2020. And these are  interesting opportunities given the size it may represent, because obviously you may multiply this  by so many countries where this will happen, Italy, Spain, Portugal, well Legrand at leadership  position being the specialist of this electrical infrastructure of the building."

Utilities, I mean suppliers of energy will not be able to develop smart grid if they  do it on their own. They will need the active cooperation of all the players up to the end-user, who  will obviously not accept to be dependent on the supplier for a smart grid efficient and intelligent  network. And we\u2019re convinced that the communication that is needed between the supplier of  energy and the end-user, we don\u2019t need a significant fundamental upgrade of the electrical and  digital, because if we say smart grid, it means intelligent, connection of infrastructure of the  building."

But you will see that actually \u2013 the rates in the first  half of 2010 were actually below the rates in 2008. So even if we see a tremendous increase  compared to the 2009 figures, we\u2019re still not back to the 2008 levels. If we adjust for increasing  bunker prices \u2013 or decreasing bunker prices compared to 2008, it gets a little bit closer but here you  can say, at this point in time, we\u2019re probably cleaned for bunker price differences at the 2008 level,  but the first half is still below. So it\u2019s not that the rates are moving through absolutely unusual  territory. It just increases to against a very weak 2009 that are unusual. So 2009 was the exception,  it is the message I\u2019m trying to bring out."

Depreciation, amortization is very much based to the same  impairment level and slightly up from last year due to the fact that we have a higher asset base in  our balance sheet. Sales gains in the first half is 551, very much influenced by the 430 million gain  on the Yantian transaction and some other minor transactions in other segments. That leaves us  the earnings before interest and tax of $5,438 million, which is a very much more \u2013 or basically  220% more than last year, and as we can see very much driven by the return to profit in the  container business.

We must say though that it is with significant uncertainty for  especially the fourth quarter this year.

That leaves us \u2013 the overall expectation for the A.P. M\u00f8ller-Maersk Group are that the result for  2010 will exceed $4 billion.

We've initiated comprehensive measures ranging from software updates and an  exchange program for older diesel models to financial support for hardware retrofits by third parties."
