        "text": "Our seventh annual Spring Black Friday delivered strong sales as the stores drove excitement around special buys  that were well-received by our customers. Comps in Gardening Tools, Soils and Mulch, Watering, Live Goods and  Patio were all above the company average. We continue to work to mitigate the effects of the drought in California  using our planning and assortment tools. We're featuring more water-saving products and landscape options like  moisture control soils and mulches, drip irrigation systems and drought-resistant plants like succulents. In  addition, our stores in California are holding clinics to educate customers on these products and how to reduce  water usage. As a result, both the Indoor and Outdoor Garden departments in the Western division posted comps  above the company average.",

New from ECHO is a  58-volt lithium-ion battery platform featuring a string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, chainsaw and  lawnmower. These tools feature a brushless motor for superior power and performance that rival and in some  cases surpass corded and gas-powered counterparts. In addition to all the great new products, we're excited about  our upcoming events. The outdoor season is upon us and we will help our customers enjoy it with an incredible  lineup of great values and special buys for our Thrill of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day and 4 of July events.",

        "text": "In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 83 basis points to 21.9%. Our expense  leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth. Total expenses were $15 million over our plan in the  quarter due to $7 million of net expenses incurred as part of our data breach and higher late-season snow removal  costs. Given our strong sales performance however, we leveraged expenses to plan. For the year, we are now  expecting our expenses to grow at approximately 35% of our sales growth rate.",
