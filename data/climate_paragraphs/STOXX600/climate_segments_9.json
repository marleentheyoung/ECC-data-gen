Our revenues for the division were up 65%, reaching \u20ac402 million, and EBITDA \u20ac209  million, an increase of 59%. This strong increase has been despite the historic low prices of the  pool market in Spain, that was 41% lower than the same period last year. And the strong growth of  the division was a combination of the contribution of Endesa assets for the first time in the first  quarter. We acquired the portfolio of Endesa in June last year, but also the contribution of the  organic growth of the Energy division of 462 megawatts in the last 12 months."

At the operating level, we would like to highlight the good performance of the Energy division relative to last year,  mainly as a result of higher production in both the Spanish and International Generation portfolios, with volumes  up 15%. This is mostly due to better resource, but also to the new commission capacity. Over the last 12 months,  we have installed 235 megawatts of new net capacity."

Net profit increased by close to 3% due to the  growth at the operating level and the decline in financial charges, despite much lower contribution from our equity- accounted investments in this quarter. Gross CapEx at \u20ac102 million is much lower than the previous year, which  included acquisition, as I said before, of Geotech in Q1 2017. 85% of this CapEx has been devoted to the Energy  division, where we currently have 589 megawatts under construction.

As summary of the key trends during the quarter, I would like to highlight the following. Firstly, the comparability of  our operating figures is still affected by the changes in perimeter, primarily the CSP business, which still  contributed in Q1 last year and, ATLL, which makes a final contribution of only two months during the first quarter  of this year. Secondly, with respect to the Energy division, the start of the year has seen low levels of wind and  hydro generation output in Spain relative to last year and relative to what we estimate to be a normal year. The  third factor to take into account to understand the operating figures for this quarter is the fact that some of our  large international construction projects are more mature and, therefore, going beyond the point of peak  production. These are higher EBITDA margin projects, but they also have higher capital charges."

What do we expect in 2013 is reflected in the next slide. According with the government estimation, the tariff  deficit, the zero-tariff deficit objective could be achieved in 2013. In our opinion, this objective can be achieved  only if two public commitments are duly fulfilled.

Our core skill is to originate design, construct  and operate these complex and critical assets for third parties or for our own portfolio. As I mentioned in the  beginning, our first hand on the ground access to greenfield projects mostly the EPC activity and to transform  these greenfield projects into Infrastructure assets is the core of our competitive advantage."

But we understand that it is sometimes difficult for the investor community to  judge our risk profile as the different sources of our cash flow vary in volatility and predictability. So, in order to  simplify \u2013 to try to simplify this analysis, we have attempted to classify our EBITDA into three different risk profiles;  long-term asset business, service business, and greenfield development or EPC business."

On the other side of the spectrum, is the  development or EPC business, with low capital intensive, therefore lower margins, high-risk, but high returns.

We would consider this an  intermediate risk profile. In conclusion, I believe ACCIONA is a unique Infrastructure developer and operator  benefiting from a highly-coveted cash-generating asset base and a greenfield activity that enhances our  investment opportunities for our own portfolio for our clients or for third-party investors.

Starting with the operating performance of the Energy business, EBITDA grew by 2.4% to  \u20ac743 million, despite $77 million contribution from the CSP assets relative to the previous year. Generation  EBITDA amounted to \u20ac821 million. On a constant perimeter or like-for-like basis, EBITDA grew by 15%, which is  a great result in our view. One of the key drivers behind the better EBITDA is the higher production of our assets,  almost reaching in 2018 what we'd call P50 or normal expected uplift for a normal year following an unusually  poor year in 2017. You may recall that 2017 was affected by the severe drought in Spain, the Mexican  earthquake, and other one-offs. Total output is therefore up 10% with Spain increasing by 7% and International by  14%."

Looking at the Spanish EBITDA, better-than-expected prices have also helped despite our high levels of hedging  during the year. Average Spanish power prices increased 10% year-on-year reaching \u20ac57 per megawatt hour and  this is the highest in history since 2008 where they traded on average at \u20ac64."

Marcelo Awad, Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Desmond, and thank you, you all for dialing in. As you may be aware, Chile was hit by a  devastating earthquake 10 days ago. Fortunately, none of our workers or contractor on site  suffered any injury. Our operations in the north were completely unaffected by this event. Los  Pelambres suffered an interruption of power supply, which was restored the following day and  reached normal capacity 72 hours later due to the need to check all equipments carefully as activity  resumed."

That means now the revenue backlog for the so-called grip projects is \u20ac64 million,  it's 37 projects, that's really the tail end of those projects that we have won over the years. And then there's the  called \u2013 the standard lump sum projects in the Environmental business, that's \u20ac48 million of backlog, that's 2,000  projects, and we are confident that the charge we took in the second quarter is really a one-off because of all that  as we have done, but also the size and the shape of the backlog of these activities."

Organic revenue growth, we  came out at 3% a positive in the present market circumstances. Overall gross revenue declined by 3% due to the  currency impacts and divestments.

Carbon credits added 5% to the EBITA and other organic was a plus  of 3% that despite the fact that we had reorganization charges of \u20ac2 million which were higher than  the year before. So if you would back that out and effect the organic, true organic growth you could  say was even slightly more than this."

The  trade receivables and work in progress did increase but also the advanced payments by customers and the  payables. For the payables, there are two facts that are worth mentioning: they went up, firstly, because of the  proportional consolidation of a joint venture we have in the Middle East where we've a joint venture with a  subcontractor. So as an accounts payable, the accounts receivable actually move up at the same time and when  you have a contract, when you're paying, when you have been paid, then that is actually a neutral net-revenue  effect but it does push up the accounts payables. And on the other hand, in the Environmental business in the  United States, we also use some subcontractors to do, as we say, the execution work, the blue collar work, and  for that outsourcing, also, the accounts payables have increased. You see a currency effect of roughly \u20ac40 million  also in equity."

This reduction in spend is significant,  and will help in correcting the supply/demand balance. And on top of this, we have seen a significant reduction in  wafer output in the memory space. This quick reaction to the changes in the end market demand is clearly  different from what we've seen in earlier cycles and will also help in correcting the inventory situation."

In response, some NAND memory manufacturers are  implementing so-called stacks of stacks where every new stack needs additional litho driving litho intensity up by  another 20%.

This is a fairly big, as you can see, centrifugal turbo machine. They come in sizes of  1, 2 and 3. And this is a size 3 that we just have launched this year. It's actually up to 35,000 cubic meters of air  per hour, so, it's a quite big machine.

And for Atlas Copco, now we, can manufacture and  have a little bit higher gross margin in product like this. So, it's a little bit of a good story how we continue to build  the business step by step. And the launch of these products have been way of our expectations.

The sales  story; as I said, we have made choices about the profitability of new business. We are quite content to see the  volumes drop to some degree, but meanwhile we see the internal rates of return on new business going up to 14%.

But also, as we ask everyone else in the food retail  business today is in a very interesting time with some clear trends going on for the future, trends that create some  challenges, but also very much some large opportunities. And I'm not going to cover all these trends in details.  We will have a Capital Market Day later on in November that we'll be able to go through a little bit more. But  clearly, urbanization, the consumer shift towards more meal solutions, increased price transparency, digitalization,  and a clearly more conscious consumer in regards to sustainability are clear trends that we need to address. And  when it comes to sustainability, it's not only the awareness and interest on how food impacts our health, but also  how food is produced and what impact this makes on our planet."

We have adjusted our equity ratio due to the new IFRS 16 reporting, as Mr. Lexmon  just reported. So, the new target is equity ratio of at least 20% at year-end. But we also expanded one of our  sustainability targets. Previously, we covered a share of sales of organic food, now we have expanded this to also  include a basket of sustainability certified goods. So, the new target is a share of total sales of at least 25% at  2025 of sustainability-certified goods."

Over time, we can see that  inflow savings and the inflow of customers are correlated well, even though that we can also see the effect on the  market climate and the risk appetite of our clients are affecting net inflow numbers. I think what's particularly  interesting with this picture is that there is strong solid growth pattern over the past 15 to 20 quarters, even though  we see that the normal Q1 boost effect that we get when people re-assess their savings for a New Year was not  as strong this year with the weakest start of the stock market in many, many years."

But the average  size of installments had been lower during the past quarters and in Q1 in particular. Mainly, actually, even though  there is an effect from new clients as well, the effect is more significant on existing clients. That turns a bit more  positive in the market climate where the net inflow is actually 70% lower than the same period last year. On the  positive note, though, is that we still see more customers than ever actually installing money, even though the  installments are slower. We expect this to return when market climate is more stable and risk appetite returns to  the market."

So, if you think about  2013, three years ahead of 2013, we were in 2010 where electricity prices \u2013 the forward prices for 2013 were still  at the level of around \u20ac60. And actually the Swiss franc to the euro was still at around CHF 1.40. And therefore,  the result of Production for 2013 is still at this very high level."

And on the one  hand, it sells it to Swiss customers; and on the other hand, into the international market. And then, if you think  three years back, these market prices in the international markets were higher than what we were able to charge  to Swiss customers. It was on a cost-regulated basis. And therefore, this shows a opportunity loss, so to speak,  that actually the entity could have been sold at the higher market price. But, we wanted \u2013 we have to and we  wanted to serve our Swiss clients at this high \u2013 at this lower level. This does not mean that the margin relative to  production cost is negative, it is still positive, but it just shows tis opportunity loss."

Operating revenue for Production division was up  because of higher generated volumes. Then, as I said, there is this internal transfer price; it was lower than 2011  and, therefore, that had a negative impact. And then, there was also some higher production cost for power  plants, for instance, for the use of water, there is a fee. And this fee, for instance, was higher in 2013 than in the  year 2012."

There  was a long-standing storm from the North and Northeast, and we had issues with the lights in the farm that break,  and there was a long time where we were not able to fix these lights. And as the lights are very important to secure  the fish not getting matured, we have had in this quarter much higher downgrade this year than normal. This  caused higher feed conversion rate, lower growth rates, higher costs and lower selling prices. So, this is the main  reason for a lower margin from Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur this quarter compared with expected numbers.

And therefore, we also guide up the harvest in 2012. We had around 4,000 tonnes from the  West and 4,100 tonnes from the North division. And Viking came out with 700 tonnes \u2013 1,700 tonnes, and Faroe  Farming 1,633 tonnes.

We guide up our volumes for this year to 48,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes with the biomass  available 1st of January, we see that we have the fish that is needed to do this production. And we guide up our  estimated smolt transfer to 11.6 million for 2012, while this is mainly due to a move in the transfer it from  December to January. We opened the factory in Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur which is increasing our capacity, but 80% of the old  capacity is already sold, so we have now opportunities to increase our sales there.

Secretary Panetta has, however,  identified $487 billion of savings over the 10-year reduction period targeted by the Budgetary Control Act. We  have assumed reductions over this period will be greater than those declared, and our current plans are based on a  $600 billion reduction. This does not address the extreme impact that would result under sequestration, but if you  put our U.S. activities in context, they represent some 40% of Group turnover.

We think these are six major drivers to impact BASF in our markets over the next years to come. I think  all they provide a positive opportunity for growth. And if you start in the upper corner, it's about demographics. It's  on one hand by 2025 \u2013 2050 that people are getting older so we have the 60-year-old fraction moving from 10%  of population to 28% of population. This is a large group which is potent, which has money, which has  differentiated needs. So, that I think gives a lot of opportunity for chemical industry, but it is also about overall  population growth. By 2050, there is still 32% more people on the planet. They need food. They need water. They  need housing infrastructure.

Second, multifunctional lightweight  construction. Many of the parts usually made from metal are now composed of fiber-reinforced plastic,  significantly reducing weight.

Wintershall will acquire equity in three producing fields from Statoil  containing 2P reserves of around 100 million barrels of oil equivalent. Through this transaction, we will raise our  production in Norway from currently around 3,000 to almost 40,000 barrel per day. This will strongly contribute  to Wintershall's operating cash flow and EBIT. In return, Statoil will receive a 15% share in the development field  Edvard Grieg, and a financial compensation of $1.35 billion. A potential payment of up to $100 million will be  made dependent on additional volumes from the development of the Vega field. The collaboration also includes  important technology-oriented topics such as joint research and projects on Enhanced Oil Recovery and the  development of unconventional deposits in Germany and also internationally.  I'm now coming to the outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we do not anticipate an upturn in the global  economy and also do not expect demand to pick up for our chemical activities. Prospects are clouded by continued  uncertainty, especially in the Eurozone and by slower growth in Asia. We therefore have adjusted some of our  expectations for the global economy. For 2012, we now anticipate chemical production to grow at 2.9%, a  reduction of 0.6 percentage points.

Concessions income from the OPAL pipeline could only partially offset this  effect. Non-compensable taxes on oil production were \u20ac492 million. Net income amounted to \u20ac322 million, an  increase of almost \u20ac100 million versus Q3 of last year. Other posted a decline in sales, largely as a result of the  divestiture of our Styrenics business, which was contributed to the Styrolution joint venture as of October 1, 2011.  EBIT before special items declined significantly. In addition to the missing contribution from Styrenics, higher  provisions for the long-term incentive program, which resulted from the significant share price increase,  negatively impacted earnings. For your reference, in the third quarter of 2011, we had reported a reversal of  provisions for the long-term incentive program, which led to an earnings increase."

These capsules are the secret to the highest energy return in the running industry. A new  development process turns solid granular material and thermoplastic polyurethane into these capsules, which  makes the shoe distinctive midsole. These capsules store and unleash energy more effectively in every stride.  Actually I tested it. This is not my shoe. This is a little bit too small. But I tested it. It's a completely different way  of running and it really brings back the energy when you move up again with every stride. So this shoe was  presented by Adidas in New York just two weeks ago.

Sales in the fourth quarter of 2018  increased by 2% to \u20ac15.6 billion. Prices were up by 2%, supported by Performance Products, Functional  Materials & Solutions, and Agricultural Solutions. Volumes decreased by 3%, mainly as a result of the low Rhine  water levels and the supply limitation of important raw materials at the Ludwigshafen site."

Another factor was a drop in  prices for key agricultural commodities.  Sales in the Crop Protection segment, therefore, fell 16%  year-on-year.

And in fact, the major feature that's going on there at the moment is  clearing out the steel. We've got substantial steel credits from that, which have helped substantially mitigate the  level of cost on the demolition and the site preparation works. Indeed, the site was very, very clean.

Profit of \u00a352 million was down on the \u00a367 million profit from last year. All of this  shortfall occurred in the first half and was due to contract start-up costs in the building and local authority  markets and some \u00a310 million of one-off increased cost in the first half on utilities contracts in Australasia.

The UK Construction business is being rationalized with a new operating model based on  just three business streams, which focus on major national projects, on regional markets and on engineering  services. This operating model will be up and running January 2013, and will allow us to reduce the number of  employees in back-office functions by about 650, and to rationalize the property portfolio from the 75 \u2013 from  about 75 locations to around 40."

And in principle, governments agree on the need for increased infrastructure investment.  So let me just summarize all of this. This was another solid set of results, with a strong, secure order book and  we're planning to underpin our financial performance with significant cost reduction and further disposals from  our portfolio of infrastructure investments. Together, we expect these measures to offset the short-term  headwinds and to provide momentum.

Looking at transport, while there has been a steady growth in this  business over the last few years, we're likely to see a fall back in this business in 20 14 as our rail renewal activity  for Network Rail comes to an end. The red line for water shows the classic characteristics of the AMP cycle with a  boost in orders leading into the cycle."

And it's abo ut how do we  actually ensure Lean delivery? I've chatted with many customers, the highways agencies and others, and it is  interesting, nobody objects to Balfour Beatty or the construction industry making a profit. What they're appalled  by is actually the waste, the waste that goes on in any delivery. It's either the waste of material or poor scheduling  and that something arrives and something isn't ready. So the fact of the matter is, I think, there's a price to be had  by eliminating the waste and sharing that with our customers and ourselves. So Lean is very, very important to us."

We realized lower lifecycle cost benefits in the Gas & Water business in 2015.  However, this is just a timing difference and we still expect to realize them in 2016 and beyond. In 2015, we had  much lower volumes from overhead power line projects as we had several big projects complete in 2014 and early  2015. Firstly, this means lower profits, but it also leaves you with an undeployed cost as you seek to retain the  skilled staff for attractive near-term opportunities. And Leo will cover some of these later in his presentation. The  prior-year number was boosted by one-off contract settlements and gains in transportation that didn't repeat in  the current year. Our performance in the second half was greatly improved, with \u00a320 million of the profit  generated in half two, representing a 3.1% margin."

This is the incidence of inventory on sales following the development direct retail channel. We think that this level  is quite fair and healthy also for the next few years. Also considering that in the previous year's inventory has  always accounted for 25%, 26% and Brunello would like to say that the following we think \u2013 I think that inventory  in apparel sector should be considered obsolete all the time. You know, that we think there are no evergreen  products in our collection, because even if a product might seem or might look particularly basic, for example, the  neckline might be longer or shorter. So, we are always very, very careful in the way we manage our inventory.  Over the years, we've had a constant source of rate of 25%, 26% without retail.

As you know, we had committed to decrease from 2016 to 2018, \u20ac3 billion. We have already  reduced \u20ac3.5 billion and effectively our intention until the end of the year is to reduce at least \u20ac1 billion more,  which means that we will be overachieving significantly this target, achieving a reduction of \u20ac4.5 billion instead of  \u20ac3 billion. This comes of course at a cost, but we think that the trade-off makes sense and this cost is influencing  our cost of risk slightly, so what we see is that we are with the cost of risk of 85 basis points and probably we will  be slightly above the 75 basis points that we had envisaged two years ago. And of course this also has an impact  in terms of ROE. But all in all I would say minor adjustments, so to say, to the metrics of the plan with the  objective of getting even more shareholder value due to the sensitiveness of the NPE reduction issues. Thank  you very much."

I must say that may be they are rather on the very positive side, I am not sure that there will be  kind of 1.8%, 2% growth.

So that means all of the environment have continued to be \u2013 stay rather positive  compared to Europe, for example.  Our approach in the mortgage market or real estate market where we carry on with the same approach, targeting  maximum increase of 4%, maybe you've heard the \u2013 received the news of the Swiss National Bank and further  accounting yesterday, I think this is a \u2013 see no surprise, that was expected.

A few days ago, we launched the new generation of NIVEA  Sun on the market. We are, by the way, the number one company in NIVEA in Sun products in the world. With  this product range, Beiersdorf not only guarantees trusted NIVEA skin protection and excellent skin tolerance but  also offers the first-time clothing protection. This makes NIVEA Sun the world's first. UV filters and sun protection  produced products frequently caused unavoidable yellow stains on clothing. This often results in lasting damage  to textiles. The new generation of NIVEA Sun and its clothing protection complex is different. Yellow stains can be  washed out for the first time, and the innovative clothing protection complex makes persistent stains a thing of the  past."
