Government spending also was a catalyst behind 16% growth in environmental and 12% growth in  forensics. In food, revenues were up 4% over last year, as results in the U.S. and Europe were offset by the impact  of the FDA restructuring in China.

That being said, we  expect total revenues to be between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, adjusted net income to be between $560 million  and $580 million and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $5.95 and $6.15, or $6.05 at the  midpoint.

As Ron said  earlier, we don't know how the environment will actually play out in 2015, but if it improves either later this year  or next, some of the $1.00 headwind may come back as a tailwind. Some of the assumptions that we have made in  preparing this guidance include the following: weighted fuel prices equal to $2.58 per gallon average for 2015,  compared to $3.56 per gallon average in 2014; market spread slightly better than average levels in the first quarter  of 2015, neutral in the second quarter and worse in the third and particularly fourth quart ers; foreign exchange  rates equal to the 7-day average ended January 13, 2015.

        "Very importantly, we've  increased substantially our backlog of future projects as Steve will explain, and we think we're looking at a bright  future for natural gas demand.",
        "As an example of the increasing demand, the power generation throughput our set  of Natural Gas Pipelines was up 16% for the first quarter compared \u2013 from the second quarter compared with  second quarter of 2014.",
        "In Texas the overall demand for gas as a source of power generation increased its share year-to-date to 48% from  37% in the first half of 2014.",
        "That's great  progress and a sign of the strength of our network and the continuing need for additional midstream energy  infrastructure.",
        "Number two, our confidence that we can extract value for short-term sales of a portion of the  unsold capacity, particularly during winter months; and third, just the overwhelming need for additional gas  capacity to serve Northeast markets.",
        "In other portions of the backlog, we also added $100 million in other projects in the gas group, $100 million  combined between products and terminals, about $300 million in additional EOR investments over the timeframe  of the backlog in the CO2 segment, and so those will be additions.",
        "Nearly all of that is further deferrals in our CO2 source field  investments outside the timeframe of the backlog.",
        "We continue to believe that we can meet the  current demand outlook for CO2 by concentrating our source development activities on the core of our portfolio.",
        "Over that period, the  price of WTI declined by 48%, and the price of natural gas declined by 43%.",
        "Certainly, there are a lot of moving pieces in there, including capital investments we've made, the commodity price  impact on CO2, et cetera, but it still sets a very important context through our performance and for the strength of  our business model in a wide variety of commodity environments.",
        "We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas  transportation capacity.",
        "And we added commitments in the East, Central and West regions and across LNG, LDC, and producer  markets.",
        "Over 400 of that is attributable to sales at existing capacity, showing again that we benefit from rising gas supply  and demand, not only in terms of new project opportunities, but also enhancing the values on some of our existing  systems.",
        "So again, the summary here for gas is, we continue to see strong demand for  existing and expansion capacity on our gas assets, and we believe that we're well-positioned for the growth that we  see in this market.",
        "Turning to CO2, which is of course very much affected by commodity prices, segment earnings before DD&A in  this segment were $286 million, down $74 million, or 21%, year-over-year due to lower commodity prices for oil  and NGLs, and including the deteriorating ratio of NGL to crude prices.",
        "Our volumes are up year-over-year, led by  SACROC at 9%, and an overall increase of 8% net to Kinder Morgan across all of our enhanced oil recovery  developments.",
        "Our refined products volumes are up 4% across all  of our systems year-over-year, in aggregate, led by higher gasoline volumes, particularly on our SFPP system.",
        "CO2 versus our budget for the full year, we're expecting that to come in in the range of about 13% below its  budget, and that's all a function of price.",
        "And the  other things that offset each other, we have cost savings in the segment, which are being offset by lower CO2  volumes and also lower capitalized overhead of CO2 spending about $450 million less than what we originally  budgeted.",
        "I should go back and say, on CO2, that price impact is going to be greater than what you would see if you applied  the metrics that we gave you at the beginning of the year.",
        "NGL prices have  deteriorated more than crude prices, and so that's having overall, on Kinder Morgan, roughly a $40 million  impact versus our budget, most of which comes in the CO2 segment.",
        "You're seeing some weakness in  steel and coal.",
        "One, the G&A as a result that we absorbed in the Hiland transaction; and  two, lower capitalized overhead than what we initially budgeted, and that's primarily because of the lower  spending in our CO2 segment.",

        "Fossil fuels, and especially natural gas, which has now surpassed coal as the primary fuel source for power  generation in the U.S., are going to be needed for a long, long time.",
        "I would add that natural gas is a key in  reducing CO2 emissions in America.",
        "For example, despite a substantial increase in electric generation over the  levels of 1993, the CO2 emissions from electric generation in 2015 were flat to those in 1993, largely as a result  of the increased use of natural gas to generate that electricity.",
        "So natural gas is playing a major role in reducing  emissions.",
        "There's a  big difference, for example, between state permitted projects where imminent domain is a function of state law,  and a federally certificated natural gas project.",
        "The changes from that $13.5 billion to the $13 billion, we put  $600 million worth of projects in to service during the quarter, including bringing on Intrastate Texas Gas  Crossover project that's in support of LNG and Mexico markets, taking delivery of two Jones Act vessels, which  are under charter, completing two smaller liquids terminal expansions and we completed phase 1 of our Tall  Cotton enhanced oil recovery project.",
        "$130 million of that in gas and $75 million in CO2  where we continue to see good returns even at current prices.",
        "CO2 is down $53 million year-over-year, due to lower prices, $62  a barrel realized versus $74 in the third quarter of last year, and lower production.",
        "Nevertheless, we expect CO2  to make plan due to some price improvement versus our planned price and good performance on cost savings by  that segment.",
        "Compared to the same quarter last year, Gas is down 2%, while Terminals and Products were up  22% and 7% respectively.",
        "Focusing on some of the broad trends affecting our business, first, in natural gas, we're seeing the demand side  developments that we anticipated.",
        "On our systems specifically, we're benefiting from increased demand for gas in  the power sector, increased exports to Mexico, and now, for the first time, increases due to LNG exports.",
        "On Kinder Morgan pipelines, power driven gas demand was up 9% 3Q-to-3Q, from 6.5 Bcf last year to 7 Bcf this  quarter.",
        "On a macro basis, gas is now overtaking coal, as Rich mentioned, as a fuel source for power generation.",
        "We're in the early days of LNG export-driven demand, but even with this Sabine Pass outage in the last two  weeks of the quarter, we experienced about 350 a day of LNG demand on our systems, and much more to come  there, we believe.",
        "Most of our $4 billion of backlog projects in the gas sector are directed at those three market trends, plus one  more, and that is the reversal projects on our TGP system to move more Marcellus and Utica gas to the South.",
        "Natural Gas, which is by far our largest segment, is kind of an 80/20 story, with approximately 80% of the budget  segment earnings before DD&A attributable to transportation and storage which benefits from the trends I just  discussed, and the other 20% in gathering and processing.",
        "But overall, this business, outside of the take or pay commitments that we have, is dependent upon the  recovery in those basins as gas demand grows and oil prices, and therefore drilling recovers.",
        "We continue to believe that the need for natural gas transportation and storage capacity will grow as the demand  trends that I talked about continue.",
        "And in the longer term, that gathering volumes flatten and turn up when we  ultimately see recovery in the gas supply basins that we serve.",
        "In CO2, we had lower volumes year-over-year for the quarter down 5%, with SACROC and Yates down year- over-year, Katz, Goldsmith and Tall Cotton up year-over-year but below our plan.",
        "The largest impact of the certain items on changes in revenues and cost of sales relates to the unrealized  CO2 mark-to-market and hedge and effectiveness impact on our change in revenues which accounts for almost  40% of the $377 million change in revenues in the quarter.",
        "We recorded a $230 million non-cash after tax, and that's why that  number is a little different from what Steve said, because this is after tax impairment on our MEP investment  driven by our expectations of lower future transportation contract rates, and approximately $350 million after tax  loss associated with the SNG transaction, most of which is non-cash book tax expense.",
        "There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, it boils down to  CO2 being down $53 million primarily on lower commodity prices.",
        "As I previously  mentioned, CO2 decreased $53 million, and Natural Gas decreased about $18 million with offsets \u2013 those two  segments were offset by increases in all of our other segments, with the largest dollar increase from the other  segments coming from our Terminals segment.",
        "The Natural Gas segment would have been slightly positive if you exclude the impact of the SNG sale, which we  sold a 50% interest in, on September 1 of this year.",

Now we  were negatively impacted, to a certain extent, in the quarter by lower commodity prices, primarily in our CO2  segment.

        "The dynamics of the residential solar market in Australia make it one of the most storage-ready regions  in the world, and our large and growing presence in the Australian solar market make it a perfect place for the  introduction of our Home Energy Solution.",
        "In addition, the Australian Government recently announced that it wants to accelerate the deployment of battery  storage in Australian households, mainly as a means to mitigate peak demand, reduce cost for consumers, and cut  emissions.",
        "Homeowners in the region want total control of their homes' energy because of the combination of  electricity rates, high solar penetration and declining feed-in tariffs.",
        "Our Home Energy Solution fit those needs  with compelling economics and sets the stage for an evolving energy market.",
        "We're confident that our AC Battery storage system with its modular architecture and seamless integration into  Enlighten will be unique in its simplicity, ease of installation, performance, and cost effectiveness.",
        "We will be  rolling out the components of the Enphase Home Energy Solution in Australia and New Zealand starting in  December, and the Enphase AC Battery storage system will be available in Australia and New Zealand during the  second quarter of 2016.",
        "It's important to note that interest in our AC Battery storage system is not limited to the Asia Pacific region.",
        "We've  been in discussions with customers in Europe, the United States, and other countries, and they're looking to  offering the Enphase AC Battery storage system and Home Energy Solution in their markets.",
        "As an example, we're cautiously optimistic about the potential storage opportunities in Hawaii as the PUC recently  issued a ruling to end net metering for all new solar customers in the state.",
        "While this could prove challenging for  the Hawaiian solar market in the near-term, we believe it creates an opportunity for our Home Energy Solution  that includes storage to lower energy costs for all consumers.",
        "In closing, we're working diligently on our cost reduction roadmap as well as new products including our fifth- generation microinverter system, the AC module, the AC Battery storage system, and the Enphase Home Energy  Solution.",
        "Since  inception, our vision has been to realize the global potential of solar energy through our technology innovation."

For example, for solar to produce an equivalent  level of power generation, it would require instead of 1,100 acre foot right-of-way of a buried pipeline, solar  equivalent would take 25,600 acre footprint of solar panels. And for wind on an equivalent level of production as  Constitution might produce, it would require approximately 2,000 turbines spread across 260 miles, which is  double the length of the Constitution buried pipeline right-of-way.

        "And for wind on an equivalent level of production as  Constitution might produce, it would require approximately 2,000 turbines spread across 260 miles, which is  double the length of the Constitution buried pipeline right-of-way.",
        "Our involvement in the Moxie Freedom project is especially unique,  as we will be the sole supplier of up to 165,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas to this new facility located just a  few miles away from our existing infrastructure.",
        "As for pricing, we are currently forecasting a company-wide natural gas differential of $0.70 per Mcf for the full  year before the impact of derivatives, which represents a $0.15 improvement relative to our 2015 differential."

The U.S., Canada, EG, and Norway sales  volumes were higher in the third quarter, largely as a result of growth in the U.S. resource plays and the  resumption of production after second quarter turnarounds internationally, offset by lower UK sales volumes as a  result of planned turnarounds.

Throughout the year, we were very active in executing these plans,  which resulted in charges of about $250 million. These actions, which should provide incremental  savings of 175 million in 2010, included staffing reductions as well as the consolidation of both back  office operations and manufacturing facilities.",

Our performance in the quarter  was impacted by continued reductions in customer spending and activity, trends driven not only by the price of oil,  but the volatility of those prices and the lack of clarity on the future. In looking back over the past few months, it's  clear to me that the movement of oil prices has been driven more by one-off events such as temporary supply  disruptions and not by a change in the fundamentals underpinning supply and demand. Therefore, I believe the  industry will remain in a period of continued uncertainty at least through the end of this year, until more  foundational changes to supply and demand create a more stable environment for our customers to plan against.",

The stimulus has been a positive for us. We\u2019ve collected a  number of stimulus projects. We believe there are many more to come. The bigger problem,  though, is that it\u2019s one of these half empty kinds of coffees thing, right. You\u2019ve got a cup of coffee  that\u2019s half full and cold. And you pour in stimulus, it warms it up. But you don\u2019t have hot coffee yet.  And I think that\u2019s the challenge we have here. Stimulus has been good. But if we don\u2019t continue to  invest in transportation and infrastructure, if we don\u2019t get, for example, some serious authorization  out of the federal government for a transportation bill, I think we\u2019re going to struggle to see the kind  of level of expenditures in transportation that would be a big positive for us. The state DOTs are just  not spending. The bond issues are slow. A couple of jurisdictions where they passed major bond  issues, they\u2019ve decided to spend the money as it comes in, rather than have a bond issue. That\u2019s  not a bad , except it drags out the level of expenditure over two decades instead of five years.
