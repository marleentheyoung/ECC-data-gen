We are revising upwards the Galp Refining margin assumptions for 2019 to  about $5, $6 per barrel, that's on the back of the expected strong demand for middle distillates. And for 2020, we  add another $1 per barrel, driven by the full contribution from the Refining efficiency initiatives and the expected  IMO disruptions during that year. Now I would highlight that our figures are now based on IFRS 16. Slides 19 and  21 provide some detail on the expected impacts to Galp and this relates mainly to leased FPSOs and subsea  equipment.

The free cash  flow of CHF 386 million represents the third highest figure in Geberit's history. At the General Assembly Meeting  on April 4, the board of directors will propose a withholding tax free distribution from reserves from capital  contributions in the amount of CHF 6.30. This represents an increase of 5% over the distribution of exactly CHF 6  per share last year. The payout ratio of 63.7% of net income is in the middle range of the targeted 50% to 70%.  During the past year, we launched a series of promising new products. With the Geberit DuoFresh, air is removed  out directly from the ceramic and thoroughly purified by a filter. This is convenient and very environmentally  friendly as less ventilation is required. Our new actuator plates meet the very highest demands of architects and  design oriented end-users. The design plate facilitates easy replacement of a traditional toilet with the Geberit  AquaClean without changes in the building structure. We designed a new concealed cistern especially for our  customers in Australia. It is particularly thin and optimized for prevailing local construction practices."

And we make the calculation that the investments we made since the alternative tunnel  Eurotunnel which are \u20ac900 million is just to highlight that even in the worst period, the  management of the group  has continued to invest in order to keep the tunnel at the best level, which I think is what we intend to pursue."

And this product, which is the so-called [ph]  venous-venous (9:02) cannula, allows to exchange oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the blood by relatively  small incision in a single cannula in the jugular of the patient. The second product acquisition we have made is  from a Swedish company called Dipylon, and they have a product called Eirus which is used for continuous blood  glucose monitoring. And just as a short, sort of, information to control the blood glucose levels in critically ill  patients within certain band \u2013 within a certain bandwidth is very important to recovery, and significant swings of  the blood glucose levels in patients can cause severe complications. And the product actually exists and is used in  clinical trials today, but we believe we have a bit of work to do to sort of package it better.

I think the market background you  guys probably understand as well as we do, but I think it's worth making some comments on the right-hand side  of that page where we've got trading. The merchanting market in the UK continues to decline along with overall  construction output in the UK being down. But we have seen a growth in constant currency terms, in like for like  turnover within our coal merchanting businesses in the UK, which leads us to believe that we are still taking  market share. And if you look at the comment we've put there about trading ahead of the market, what I would say  is we have been particularly strong in terms of plumbing and heating against the plumbing and heating market  and also particularly strong in insulation and drylining. But overall, our merchant business in the UK has traded  ahead of the market."

An incredibly heavy rainfall in  April and June certainly impacted the sales of gardening and leisure products in the Woodie's and Atlantic DIY  chains.

But the impact in terms of Basel 2.5  whether it's about disposing of this asset or cracking the CDO is a positive one. It's relatively positive under Basel  2.5 definition, above 10 bps. It's even more efficient than the Basel 3, which is not material yet, but which is  important for my next point regarding our roadmap to Basel 3.

So, the both combined have allowed us to raise \u20ac20 billion of medium, long- term money so far this year; with I think something very important not only because of the money, which is a  concern but also from the symbolic perspective. The fact that we've been able to raise $1.25 billion last month in  the U.S., which I think a year ago, nobody would have thought about that. So I think it's important both from our  signature perspective as well as from the environment perspective, it's a very important signal that the world,  from the liquidity perspective, has changed a lot for us in a year.  As far as short-term liquidity is concerned, we have maintained a strict cover of our short-term commitments with  liquid asset buffer. We have also provided, I would say, some \u2013 a little bit of fuel to our short-term activities,  which are also \u2013 which we are also able to preserve in terms of flexibility. So we are able to slow down these, if  necessary. So it's just also a way to benefit from the environment so far this year.

It's  been a successful project for Cameroon, and there's a 13.7 meter oil column was discovered in the main prospect  with a total net oil pay of 6.2 meters, which has significantly de-risked the adjacent lying areas at similar depths  there.  So we will have further appraisals of that during 2013, and we believe this is a substantial field with recoverable oil  potentially between 38 and 90 million barrels of recoverable oil, if the adjacent untested structures are included  over there.

As our Industrial has gone from $5.3 billion to the $6.6 billion,  clearly the big driver has been increase in commodity prices, $1.9 billion. To break that up, we've seen increases  in the copper business, which is helped by the cobalt by-products and various others. $0.6 billion of that $1.9  billion is in copper. Zinc's had an increase, $0.3 billion on pricing, the nickel business $0.3 billion as well, ferro  $1.1 billion. Giving $1.3 billion overall for the Metals business. And on the Energy, we've had $0.6 billion, which is  coal at $0.5 billion and oil is at $100 million increase. And expanding off a low base as well, we should see some  \u2013 having bottomed out in terms of our oil production in West Africa, we should start seeing some increases over  the coming periods as well."

We really develop brownfield, the easier  projects, and our pipeline remains overall on time and on budget.

There's obviously a range still as we're working t hrough the  final plans, but that range is quite \u2013 is obviously quite lower. And I think one of the flexibilities and just allowing  for that range, and I'm sure there'll be questions on that later on, is just a little bit of what's the final capital as we  move forward in terms of Koniambo as well. So there's a bit of flex in it for that as well between the $6.5 billion  and $6.8 billion range as well."

As I stood up here I think last time and I said yes we can bring working cap ital down.  What would the impact be? Some impact but not a very material magnitude so as to affect that business in terms  of its core earnings, its core franchise value and the likes as we move forward.

We've seen strong improvements 2015 to 2016 in particularly the base metals. Coal margin improving, that's  always a balance between cost and margin as you look to obviously go and mine different segments and different  coal qualities. And we look at that business in as much as cost, but it's equally important from a margin  perspective."

We've given some components of that cobalt at  Mutanda. In terms of that additional volumes, we saw 25,000 tonnes of cobalt come out there, an extra 8,000  tonnes or 48% increase in the cobalt. And it really does underpin on it, post by-product basis, the lowering of the  cash flow structures we see over at Mutanda."

So we've taken the most  conservative part of that range. What's driving that range, $0.92 to $1.25, cobalt. There's nothing else that's  driving that range. So, at the bottom end of the $0.92, what we've assumed, let's say in the $1.25 is that we are  not selling about 25,000 tonnes of cobalt this year on what we're producing."

We've also run through that  particular model on spot prices the realization of cobalt hydroxide as some benchmark would indicate it might be.  It's very low volume, it's very illiquid at the moment, but we've taken about $11.50 a pound is the price that that's  [ph] on the market (00:26:29)."

So, you can have your own views as to  where the volume and price is going to potentially \u2013 and we do speak about the cash flow generation, the $6.8  billion that Ivan said, that's at the conservative $1.25.

What I thought I would do is just reflect a  little bit on where we are from a strategic point of view and just bring out some of the changing  shapes of the business that we\u2019re moving forward on. It\u2019s just about two years since I stood up for  the first time and talked to you about the strategy of the company and I think it\u2019s a reasonable  moment just to reflect on how that\u2019s really played out. In many regards, everything we anticipated  about this sector has played out very much as we thought it would, so increasing pricing pressure,  increasing generitization, more demand for differentiated products, all of those pressures that we  anticipated have really come through and I think in many regards we feel probably more confident  around the strategy that we\u2019re deploying at the company now than we even did two years ago.  There\u2019s been absolutely nothing happened in the last two years which has kind of been a surprise  from the direction of travel that we anticipated the environment would go in."

So, all these elements are necessary to make that this  LNG as a fuel becomes a reality, and this is progressing well for each of them. The first one is, of course, the  regulatory framework.

[indiscernible] (15:59) LNG must prove economically feasible and sustainable. And this comes down to two  elements which are also progressing.

We think that there is a need for additional capacity and we are going to show  you that, and there are new trade routes which are determining the higher need for LNG carriers. Well, we don't  deny the fact that we are currently in a quite troubled context with significant oil and gas price tag. You know that  LNG prices are determining according to a percentage of oil prices. So whenever oil is falling down, LNG prices  are falling down or it was largely like that. It's a bit different now with the American gas which is determined  according to a price of gas in the US, but this price as well is very low. And I guess you should know that  [indiscernible] (00:16:28) is \u2013 there are global economic concerns which render decisions a bit difficult currently.

So, gas should increase and LNG in this increasing envelope should increase its  own share. So, gas is abundant. It's fairly well spread out. It's by far the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel. And  there are some geopolitical and original drivers which are determining that. So, we think that additional energy  capacity are needed. Why? In fact, if we look at the fields which are operating currently, we can see the other  projects decided we can see that by the beginning of the next decade, let's say by 2020 or 2021, production  should begin to decline. And, of course, if what I say is true, it's a \u2013 if gas is clean, if gas is attracted in terms of  pricing. If gas is not raising major political concern compared to other energies, gas should continue to be  demanded and we should not see a decline of LNG in the next decade."

So, if we need additional capacities by 2021, decisions have to be taken last year for  greenfield projects or this year or next year for brownfield projects.

It's  not the pendulum pattern and you need more ships because ships may go from one place to another one, longer  one, may wait \u2013 maybe trading opportunities, so that is determining a much higher need for ships."

And with more standard  pricing structure, it may be a very affordable solution.

We saw in 2017, a very large order from  CMA CGM for nine containerships with very large tanks, 18,000 cubic meters, so one-tenth of the volume of LNG  carrier. So, it gives to the owner, the capacity to go from Europe to Asia and back with only one way shooting. So,  I think that for the owner, it's a [indiscernible] (00:17:17) count, allowing them to bank at a very competitive price  in a given place of the world, because you have a quite large spread in LNG prices according to the place in the  world where you bank.

LNG was  born in the 1960s, but up to the beginning of the past decade, few ships were delivered. Most of these ships are  still in operations. They are smaller than the existing ones and they have a fairly high boil-off rate, which means  that even though they have low rates \u2013 low prices to be fairly affordable to chart, their economics are not that  compelling on very long routes such as Gulf of Mexico to Asia where the shipping segment is [ph] waging a lot on  the cost of the delivered molecule (00:10:30). The ship on this trade is performing five voyages about a year and  so the cost of shipping is very significant in the [ph] cost of the delivered molecule (00:10:46).

We divided in half the boil-off ratio, which is one of the fundamental characteristics of  LNG containment system. We are trying also to deploy digital strategy. So why do we do that? First of all, we are  working on that for several years since 2013, where we began to work on several software applications. We think  that softwares can help owners to switch to LNG, whether we are relying on expertise of [ph] cruise (00:23:35) as  on LNG carriers, a lot of things could be done by software, so we are working on that. We think also that in order  to be more efficient, ships should rely more on data management. You can collect a lot of data on the  performances of the ship, on the engines, on the conception of course on the cruise, on the route, and you can  optimize the performances, the energy performances of the ship.

At the same time, the capacity of the existing Sindri grinding plant, which is a bit  northeast in Jharhand will be increased by 1.35 million tonne per year. And a new grinding plant will be built with  a capacity of 2.7 million tonne in Kharagpur, that is east of Jamul and it is now located in West Bengal and quite  close to Kolkata. And both grinding plants will be supplied with clinker from Jamul, and it's planned to start  operation of the new facilities toward the beginning of 2015.

Electricity also in Europe is very much down due we had now  warm weather in March and in April. We had a lot of windmill and solar energy so the spot prices in Europe are  down. Coal is down at the moment in Asia, also coming down more in Europe. In Asia the main reason is that the  biggest coal importer is obviously China. China has stopped by law cement and steel production in the first  quarter in some provinces. That's reduced the imports of coal significantly and that has a softening trend on coal.

What we see is that we had a negative inventory impact also mainly due to the region north  because in the region north, especially the whole area around New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland,  and then up to Ohio and up to Chicago had a lot of snow. We still have drizzles now even in April. So, it was a  really harsh winter, and that is about 40% of our cement volume. So, we are really at a footprint disadvantage.  That's why our cement volume is minus 4.6%. If you compare them, for example, with our Mexican comparables  where we are up 5%, then that is absolutely consistent because they have no footprint in the north. They are  much more in the south, and that's what you see."

And we have announced now a price  increase 4th July in Indonesia. China, I mentioned North is in a consolidation phase. In the South weren't sure,  volumes are okay; pricing is okay; profits are up.  India had weak first six months. The cement market grew only 1%, it was even negative with minus 1% in the  second quarter. There are the questions what's the reason for that. We see two main reasons. First of all,  government projects were very slow, practically no new infrastructure projects. And on the second \u2013 and the  second part is, India experienced a very high inflation rate in 2011, starting in the later part of 2010. The Federal  Reserve has reacted in India, and I think they have pushed interest rate three or four times. And inflation is eating  up the money at the Indian level, which is available for building materials because they have to spend more money  for food. And that's what we saw that also private consumption in rural India was very weak and that has negative  impacted our volumes and sales."

That is for us a problem in Indonesia and Thailand and, to a certain extent, also in  India. And you see how the price really went up. And when we made the budget in Indonesia in November,  beginning December 2017, the price was at around maybe $88 and now the price actual is about $123. You see  really the major movement. And the coal consumption in Indonesia for the full year is about 2.4 million tonnes."

However, the price difference between local coal and, for  example, international coal, Newcastle or API in Europe, is between $32 up to $50 per tonne.

So if you want to buy clinker now in Shanghai FOB, you have to pay between $36, $37, up to  $38 per tonne. It's the similar thing in the Mediterranean. That's why for the Turkish guys, for example, now  exporting clinker is, due to the weakness of the Turkish lira, more attractive than to sell domestically. And that  shows you that the domestic markets are strong and there is clear demand of clinker on the global seaborne  market. And the last point is freight trades are up between 20% to 40%, which gives a good base for strong  domestic pricing, because clinker is up, freight is up, fuel is up. That means for importers, it's much more difficult  than a year ago."

We have already reached $294 million of the total proceeds in the first six  months of this year, mainly coming from disposal, white cement assets and limestone bricks in Germany. We still  have a quite comprehensive list of assets to dispose of. These are mainly non-core assets, like white cement  activities, or we still have a paper bag factory on sale and some other of that type. We have a significant number  of idle assets, which are for disposal, such as unused land, depleted quarries, and things like that, and certainly  we have a number of, what I would call, irrelevant market positions, terminals in Sri Lanka, for example, or in very  small countries which we have on the list.

If you look to the cement market now, we are in the first nine months, I  think the U.S. market is close to zero. The PCA forecast is for a growth of 1%. When we started the year, PCA  was for about 3.54%. Last year, we did 4%. So the market is clearly slower. And then we have the hurricane  season, obviously, which has hit us a little bit in the Houston area and in Florida. And against that background  also in Q3 on a like-for-like basis, we have increased the [indiscernible] (02:49) by 10%, I think that's a very solid  performance."

And as you  have seen, we are lowering our guidance on increase of fuel cost, mainly for two reasons. First of all, the strong  euro helps us quite a bit, because the fuel bill is typically paid in U.S. dollar. And secondly, in the operations, we  have managed successfully to a large extent shift in the fuel mix, so we have moved away from high priced, high  quality coal and petcoke to lower calorie coal or to higher sulfur petcoke. And this overall led to a saving in energy  cost of about \u20ac40 million."

And that's why the energy guidance is now down to  about a full year guidance of mid-single-digit. And that's a strong performance, because you have to see the coal  price and the petcoke price in 2017 compared to 2016 is up by around 40%. You know what I mean, if you look to  petcoke, we talk now about pricing \u20ac60 per tonne; a year before, which we're now talking about \u20ac40, \u20ac41. And  also the Newcastle, the Asian coal is around \u20ac80 against last year, maybe \u20ac55. So, we had a significant increase  and so we managed that quite well."

Germany, which is from a kiln setup, very comparable to Italy and also to France, the meantime between  failure in our German plants, which have a much higher alternative fuel rate than France and Italy, is about 330  hours."

Major reductions will come from Morocco, but also from Egypt, and we still have social  planning negotiations going on in some countries in Europe. And Dr. N\u00e4ger will talk about tax and refinance costs,  which have decreased in the Italcementi [indiscernible] (14:37). So, the synergy target will be clearly  overachieved.

What's the reason is the October, we had the volumes for October,  October was very strong, we had in cement the strongest month in Heidelberg's history with an increase of  volumes of about 7.5%, also aggregates was up more than 5%. So, October figures should be solid and we keep  the fingers crossed that the weather is not turning crazy too early in November or December and as you know,  the comparison with last year is relatively weak, we had a disappointing Q4 last year.

And the Indonesian result has been burdened on the cost side mainly by the significant increase in  coal price, that's what I mentioned earlier. You have to know that Indonesia is for us the biggest coal consumer in  the group, they consume about 2.2 million tonnes, 2.3 million tonnes on a yearly basis. So, any movement of the  coal price by about $10 per tonne cost us \u2013 or we gain about $20 million, $23 million."

That is nice for the top line of Heidelberg,  but it is not good for the margin because the trading margin is very low, so that has a negative impact on our  group margin. The more important message is that the clinker exports from China have been reduced this year by  about 57%. That shows that the Chinese government has a clear no-export policy for clinker and cement. The  domestic market is stronger, and we have production cuts, which are ordered by the government. That also keeps  the price up. And we see also in Asia that the clinker price for export FOB is moving upwards by $1 or $2, that's  also good news for our industry. That's it from the markets."

Circular economy, I think, we can do much more on recycled concrete and recycled aggregates. There is still a  big improvement potential and we want to be a good neighbor, so we are paying our taxes, we are not using any  tax havens, crazy island, so we are not very much concerned about the Paradise Papers, and in the countries  where we are operating we typically engage very much in social services like entertaining, schools, kindergarten,  health services, et cetera, especially in emerging markets."

And then you see on the next chart our commitment to reduce CO2 emissions. In Heidelberg, we are  focusing mainly on three areas, first of all, we concentrate in one initiative on reducing the CO2 emissions by  reducing the clinker content in cement, in that way also by producing low CO2 clinker by replacing limestone as a  coal material, for example, by aluminium ash, we are relatively advanced in that respect and with that technology  we could use our existing plants and able to reduce the CO2 footprint by about 30%."

We will be \u2013 we will benefit from our good footprint especially in  California, Washington and also in Texas where we expect significant growth next year. We see Europe further  coming back in volume, but especially also on pricing and another key point is obviously energy cost. At the  moment, we see energy costs next year being flat.

And that's what we have done in 2011.  The charts four and five just underpin what I told you. You see the volumes up in Cement by about 12% and  Ready-mix 12%, and Aggregates 6%. Aggregates is lower because of its presence in mature markets. From this  figure, what these figures tell you is also very simple. Sales up 10%, Cement up 12%, and Ready-mix also 12% and  Aggregates 6%. That shows you the top line was okay. We don't have a pricing problem. The problem on the  margin was driven by increased energies cost in the Cement division and missing CO2 income. Whereas we didn't  have a margin problem in the Aggregates business, which shows again that also our product portfolio is very good  because the Aggregates division has a clear stabilizing factor especially if markets are very volatile."

If you might recall, last year, we had a negative price inflation of  about minus 2.5%. Now, after the first two months, we are, in the cement division, again down compared to last  year about 1.6%, on the total group, 2%. That's mainly driven by cheaper coal in Europe, but also in Asia where  prices are down $7 , $8, whereas electricity is slightly up.

So, I would expect for the area of Boston, New York maybe a price  increase of $2 per tonne reaching then maybe then $110, but it's clear that here, pricing environment will be more  difficult."

We have been launching a new  Heineken global campaign around the theme \"Open Your World.\" We have devoted a lot of energy, money, and  time to the activation of the brand here in the UK, launching the campaign but also organizing the Heineken Cup  and the Champions League, which the final was organized here in London, so we kind of painted the city in green  for that weekend."

As far as waste is concerned, we had a reduction in  consumption and therefore an impact on waste. And on top of that we also had the month of February, which was  specifically negative for the waste activities, but due to the fact that for two weeks waste could not be collected  because of the locations they were situated in could not be reached by our trucks and some of our sites couldn't be  reached due to the snow, but that was a very specific event."

What brought about these trends in special waste wasn't so much linked to market conditions, but rather it was  due to the combination of a couple of phenomena, which had an impact on our capacity, almost linked to our  waste-to-energy, two specifically, the waste-to-energy plant in Bologna and the one in Pozzilli had breakdowns  which happened during the first quarter, which brought the waste-to-energy plants to a stop for a few weeks,  which obviously reduced our available capacity by some 30,000 tons."

The first refers to the divestment from the activities we had in the City of Sassari and  Sardinia, which we sold to the Itau Gas Group in early-April, which means that that activity was deconsolidated in  Q1 this year.

It reduced  the opportunities to optimize gas both through import networks and referring to the gas stocked in the storage  units.

And in this case, it was higher in urban waste rather than special waste, and  this may come as a surprise. The reason isn't necessarily linked to the overall trends. The reason is that whereas in  terms of urban waste, we are limited by territorial elements, whereas as far as \u2013 and in terms of special waste,  we've been able to tackle things with a more aggressive commercial approach."

Therefore, the results actually illustrate these dynamics. Based on all this, if we look at the  volumes, what can we actually observe? Well, we've had a total amount of volumes sold to third parties which is  above \u20ac3 billion, it's at \u20ac3.3 billion actually. \u20ac1.2 billion of this was represented by the Hera trading wholesale  have an impact compared to the previous year and significantly at that because we had a contraction equal to 120  million cubic meters, nonetheless, the results were quite satisfactory."

Now, in commenting this figure, three factors need to be underlined, the first of which is the growth in  the free market which net of switching and new of switching from the salvaguardia market equal to 50,000  customers which is a significant number indeed, contribution to this came from the activity in the salvaguardia  sector, which as you know from the beginning of the year covers six territories vis-\u00e0-vis the previous three  territories with the one further terawatt per hour sold and these combined elements allowed us to reach year end  at 480,000 customers and according to the figures we were looking at today, we are close to reaching 0.5 million  customers."

This is the context we're looking at, and our growth was marked positively at the end of the  year by reaching the same results we had in 2015, by recovering the \u20ac2 million to \u20ac3 million that we had been  dragging on for most part of the year."

This is the sum of a  number of different components, among which we have the contribution stemming from the marketplaces which  grew on average by 10% throughout the year, although we had a piece which were well above that up to 20% or  30%. This contribution was strengthened by the profitability on the production of renewable electricity, which  benefited from the price dynamics we had in 2018. Although its positive effect was eroded by the lower volumes  we were able to manage due to a limitation on the ability to dispose of waste and that was equal to some 100,000  tons over the year. This is, of course, removed a potential business, although compared to the previous year we  were still able to post \u2013 we posted a slight contraction.

This facility is 253,000 square feet in area, so it\u2019s a huge facility. And part  of that facility \u2013 they started construction to create new cleanrooms, but it was stopped. And I would  say maybe 20% was completed and then it was stopped. So we came \u2013 we were looking now to  complete that project. Looking at installing state-of-the-art equipment to sustain this business and  maybe grow it to increase the efficiency. I mean, efficiency is very, very important when you talk  about large facilities like this. And also making it more reliable and more flexible than it is today."

Two-thirds of what we're selling is, as I say, existing buildings, so it's not a sector which is reliant on  new construction. And over 95% of what we sell is non-residential buildings. So it's in the commercial  environmental. The blue part there, we call others, that's really selling sensors into transportation markets.

That's something we  expect to improve as we go through this financial year."

So, for  example, our R&D investment in that sector increased by over 4% despite the reduction in revenue. And secondly,  a mixed issue, so the average margin \u2013 gross margin we make from products we sell into oil and gas industry are,  in general, higher than the margins we sell into \u2013 the margins we make selling to non-oil and gas customers, and  we saw that impact on the trading in that sector during the year."

And then Process Safety's recovery shows through in both Process Industries which were  up 5%, and also interesting Energy and Resources up 2% organic constant currency through the year."

So, UK water utilities, certainly spent \u2013 invested more in the second half of the year and they're kind of  halfway through their five-year [indiscernible] (33:55) investment cycle. So, we'd expect to see a continued  improved investment as we go through certainly the first part of the current year.

That's what we refer to as organic constant currency growth. And again, you can see really good growth  across all the regions. U.S.A. grew by 9%. You may recall that U.S.A. was up 6% in the first half and that  accelerated growth in the second half to 12%. Environmental & Analysis, really strong second half in the U.S. UK  grew by 9%, pretty even growth across the year. Mainland Europe up 8%, similar growth to that in the first half.  We had France down but Germany, Holland, Scandinavia all nicely up. And Asia Pacific grew well throughout the  year. It was up 14%. China was up 18% with growth in all four sectors. And the Other regions were up. We were  strong in Near and Middle East, otherwise good in Canada which we count in the other territories, mixed across  much of South and Central America but actually a strong performance in Brazil."

The first half/second half split was 44%/56%, very  close to our typical 45%/55% first half/second half split. And again, you see on the right hand side of the chart  here the organic constant currency profit growth increased from 8% in the first half to 9% in the second half,  giving 9% for the year overall. Breaking down that organic constant currency performance, we saw Environmental  & Analysis growing strongly through the year, Process Safety growing in the second half but not as fast as in the  first half, solid performance from Infrastructure Safety, and Medical as we expected recovering to growth in the  second half."

The main currencies for us are the U.S. dollar and euro, to a lesser extent the  Swiss franc and the Chinese renminbi; all of that relative to sterling. So if we look forward in 2018-2019, if the  U.S. dollar relative to sterling was around $1.35, and that compares to $1.33 average rate in 2017-2018, and if  the euro is around \u20ac1.13 then if we based on last year's 2017-2018 mix of profits we probably expect a 1%  adverse currency translation impact for the year, bringing more like 2% in the first half and then reversing  somewhat in the second half. Just a reminder that it's Medical and Environmental & Analysis that have the most  benefit from a weaker sterling. But obviously sterling has been quite volatile over the past months. What I've just  given you is one potential 2018-2019 version of impacts on one set of assumptions. There's more information in  the appendices to the slide pack including the impact to 1% changes in currency on the results. So I think it's  worth having a look at your models to update your own models based on your own assumptions."

Our Medical sector had really good revenue growth throughout the year, and as expected it  improved its profitability in the second half of the year. And then Environment & Analysis, you can see the  outstanding performance even if you exclude the benefit of the reorganization of Pixelteq in the prior year; very  strong underlying growth there. As Kevin mentioned, there's currency and M&A impacts on all these figures. So if  we have to look at the organic constant currency growth figures, you get a better sense of the underlying  progress. But it's a similar picture in many sense because you've got good organic constant currency revenue  growth in all sectors, good organic constant currency profit growth in all but the Medical sector which is marginally  down organically for the full year. Just to put that into context, at the end of H1 the Medical sector had a 6%  organic constant currency decline in profit, so we saw a 4% organic constant currency improvement in profit in the  second half of the year to finish up where we did. So overall I'm very pleased with the organic growth we've  achieved across the four sectors particularly against the backdrop of the increased investment that we've been  making this past year. I'm going to talk a little bit about the digital investment in a moment but also our R&D spend  was up by 12% at the group level during the year, just underpinning the fact that the companies are still investing  growing their core."

So you can see growth in all of our industries, all of our  end markets, very much of similar patents what you'll see in the sector. So our highest rate of growth is in science  and environmental which is a key part of our Environmental & Analysis sector. Energy was up nicely; that's part of  our Process Safety sector, a big part of that sector. Buildings is the core of our Infrastructure Safety sector. And  then the progress that we've made in our Medical sector is reflected in the growth there in the health and medical  end market. And for me, this demonstrates a couple of things. The obvious point is the diversity of the group in  the markets we serve but also the value of those long-term growth drivers, so increasing health and safety  regulation, increasing demand for health care and life critical resources you see playing out when you look at the  widespread growth we've got across all of these end markets.

But also excellent performances in Asia Pacific and Other regions which include the  Middle East. Solid growth in Mainland Europe. More modest growth in the UK; that's a big market for our Gas  Sensor business which I mentioned earlier had a slightly lower rate of growth than elsewhere in the sector. But  overall, good performance in Process Safety. The sector's going to continue to invest in new products, in new  markets, in building out its organization because we still want to make it more resilient to sustain growth almost  whatever happens in the oil and gas market. But we expect this sector to make progress in the year ahead with  the momentum that it has."

You see that \u20ac135 million on a net basis,  followed by Camp, the wildfire in the U.S., by \u20ac130 million, followed by the others. So a lot of frequency, again,  the retro structure which we have in place, the K quota share, the whole account protection, plus the aggregate  large loss cover, was very sufficient and that should also be the reason as to why future development is  potentially really limited."

We  published a decision close to a month ago about focusing the Hallsta Paper Mill more on the MF Magazine grades,  because we are closing \u2013 we intend to close the PM 3 machine producing 140,000 tons of SC paper, that's for all  next year and in the meantime, we would invest and rebuild part of the energy supply situation, it enables us, at  the end, to close both the paper machine but also to close a big part of the heavy energy supply side. And we  expect a total of some 230 people \u2013 that we can actually reduce the costs and the personnel by 230. So for us, this  is a good move. It's not normally not so easy to just close the machine and get a good \u2013 better situation, but we  will get a better situation, we will refocus the mill on those two machines making book paper and MF Magazine, so  for us, it's a good move.  Then we work, of course, across the line with increased productivity at the same time, and we have a good  development, specifically in Spain, as Spain has been \u2013 sort of have been in a tough situation for many years. But  now, since we closed the machine and we have worked with productivity, we can actually see that we are earning  money in Spain, and we are very happy with that."

Then we encountered very high harvesting  cost during the spring period or the winter and spring period. And it was followed by forest fires during the  summer that cost us some extra money.

Going in Q4, as Henrik had mentioned,  we have seen some price declines on lower quality grades, and we have also had a weaker market mix. That's  not unusual. In a normal market, Q4 has quite a weak market mix. What we did also face in this quarter was a rise  in log costs.

It will talk about mobility and transportation,  whether it's road traffic, whether it's rail traffic, whether it's ship, or whether it's airplane traffic.

We've had a decision after long debates to shut down the nuclear power plants. [ph] Edison (35:47)  have been shut down straight away. Not only since this decision, but before that, it becomes obvious that we need  to renovate ways and reinvent ways we generate energy. And that requires actually huge investment. And this  investment through the renewable side requires enormous activities on wind energy side, the offshore wind  energy side. And we'll probably get an understanding regardless whether it's offshore wind or whether it's gas- fired power plant or whether it's water power generation. All this comes with an enormous effort of construction  work and logistical work."

Otherwise, we will be in trouble with the nuclear power plants being  shut down and having no new energy supply in place. And the same is true in the UK when you just look to the  amount of wind farms they have already approved, permitted, and brought to market just for the UK. Those things  don't build just from themselves. You need to have a logistical concept to transport 100 meter wind blades \u2013 100  meter long wind blades, across the country to a shipping harbor. And you may end up finding out that you have no  suitable harbor close by a wind park."

And we actually can build harbor and we've built harbor. And we actually have ordered ships and will  have the first ship innovation being delivered in 2012 to do the transport and not only the transport but also the  installation of these wind farms and have not even started to discuss the need for power transmission and grids.  With this new concept, we have a situation that all the traditional power plants were sitting close by the  consumers. So we have here in the rural area, we have in Southern Germany, whether it's the Stuttgart or the  Munich area, all of a sudden the power generation is about 500 kilometers, 800 kilometers away from those  consumers. We need to bring power, but we have no net, no transmission net lines. So we need to build these  transmission lines. In Germany it's 3,600 kilometers."

The concept for this business is no longer to build up a portfolio of assets, which we hold and manage, but actually  to develop the assets to increase the value of those assets when we develop them because we believe that this is  what we can really well; to have a concept, to have a plan, to get the plan approved and to construct and start  operations. And after completing this, we have added 95% of what we can add to the value of an asset, and then  it's time for us to sell the asset, take the money to develop a new one."

Profit before tax also  increased substantially to \u20ac600.5 million clearly exceeding the previous year\u2019s result.  Net profit  rose as well, reaching \u20ac195 million.  My colleague, Burkhard Lohr, is going to explain some  adjustments made to the \u201808 figures. But these figures mean we have either reached or we have  exceeded all of our targets we have set ourselves for the business year 2009.

Our subsidiary Turner was  able to reinforce its position as the number one general builder in the United States benefiting from  its specialization in relatively stable market segments such as education and healthcare and cross- segment green buildings.  New contracts included two campus facilities in Los Angeles and New  York, a hospital at Princeton University, a Cancer Research Center for the University of Chicago  and construction of Yale University\u2019s Yale New Haven Hospital.  Thanks to such projects, Turner  has been able to compensate to a certain extent the weakness of the private construction market in  the United States."

The consortium around  Leighton\u2019s subsidiary Thiess is designing, financing, and construction of Australia\u2019s most modern  seawater desalination plant near Melbourne.  The contract has a volume of roughly \u20ac2.1 billion.  At  the Australian Duralie mine, Leighton contractors will act for further seven years as project  manager, the \u20ac251 million contract, with an annual production volume of 1.8 million tons of coal.   On the island of Saadiyat off the coast of Abu Dhabi, the joint venture around the Al Habtoor  Leighton Group will be realizing the St. Regis Hotel and Residences project, half of the contract  value of just under \u20ac345 million is attributable to Al Habtoor Leighton."

One of our  options at that point in time was to accept significant markdowns on what we and our analysts had  identified as a fair value.  However, we did not and still do not see any reason to sell below value.   This would have significantly contradicted our intention namely to show and to generate value.  And  as my colleague Burkhard Lohr is going to point out in a few minutes, we were and we still are  under no pressure at all to sell.  Therefore, we are confident that we made the right decision in  stopping the IPO and several investors confirmed to us immediately after that, that we were indeed  \u2013 that we have indeed made the right decision."
