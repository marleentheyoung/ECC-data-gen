If you look at that 18% improvement in operating costs the last two  years, in the last 12 months, the improvements at Moranbah have been well documented. What hasn't been as  public and certainly one that we'll talk more and more about, I hope, in the next few months is the improvement  of Grasstree. So, taking the lessons from Moranbah where we've almost doubled the cutting out. And I think,  Seamus, we're up at about 115 hours a week as we speak. That's a significant improvement from where we were in  59 hours a week, so significant improvement across the business. We've taken that model in the Grasstree. And  then, taking that model into Grosvenor certainly enhances the returns that we'd originally forecast from  Grosvenor. So, very pleased with the results."

But Seamus and the team  are managing what they can manage. If we have to make some tough decisions on reducing our capacity, we will  go there.

Seamus and the  team had to do some tough stuff \u2013 Seamus and Godfrey had to do some tough stuff in the last few days advising  people of the reduced numbers in the thermal coal business. You have seen or we have seen a drop in operating  profit in particular, price-driven. But we do have some quality issues, but we've put some coal into India and those  contracts or those sales have gone well. And from a standing start nine months ago, when we said to the team that  we won't accept a 30% reduction in the next six to seven years in terms of volumes and a commensurate drop in  performance, they've done a great job in identifying how they can hold production improved margins and in  looking at different contract positions, it might not be exactly the same quality, but in terms of cost, delivery and  margins, doing really good work in terms of preserving our returns."

We agreed at the end of June to actually cut the power back on the furnaces, do  some rebuild work around the walls of the furnace, change some operating practices, and really change the  philosophy that is consistent with the operating model we're currently designing for implementation across the  group. It's very similar to what Seamus and the team are doing at Moranbah and Grasstree, but, again, looking at  how we do that differently and how we apply it to nickel. We've seen a 44% improvement in nickel production,  and it's somewhat counterintuitive; when you reduce the power, you'd expect to see less nickel. This is all about  getting stability and getting our operations delivering in a controlled environment. So, very pleased with the  performance."

Again, I get a bit of a spring in my step despite the hip when I look at niobium and  phosphates, because I hadn't even thought about that as part of the portfolio when I started in April and I saw  Ruben, who's an old Vale colleague of mine, being very excited. So, the fresh rock project in Niobium will start to  make a contribution this year. And it is part of our improvement program. And certainly, 2015, 2016 looks pretty  good. It is, from our point of view, a structurally solid market. We're, I think, the number two player now. And it is  dominated by CBMM and so from our point of view, they have \u2013 they appear to be behaving rationally in the  market. Certainly, from our point of view, it's been a good business, good returns and certainly, we expect to see  continuing improvement, both in Niobium and in the longer term, with Phosphates. We have upside capacity in  our existing operations and we've just found a new deposit and being in Brazil, where Brazilians are significantly  short phosphate, some 40% short of phosphate, we're sitting on their doorstep and it's one of the most dynamic  agricultural regions in the world. So it's a great place to be. And it's a very good business and very happy. And we  think we can continue to put just a bit of incremental capital in and make very good returns, so a great place to  invest."

The issue of risk, understanding what it is and trying to make sure we're more reliable  contributors and operators in the business, is very much about the technical changes we're ringing through the  organization. And again, while that may take 12 to 18 months to roll through, in the end, it improves our  reliability, it improves performance.

The good news is, we're now a 50% owner of the facility. We  have veto on all key operating decisions.

And with that, we saw a $600 million  improvement in the underlying performance of the business, $4 million (sic) [$400 million] taken back on  headwind, so net-net, a $200 million improvement, which is part of the driver for the improved performance in  the business."

So, it's not only about cost  reduction. It's about improving the quality and the performance of the business on a sustainable basis and that's  where there's a big leverage for us as a business."

But the great thing about Barro-Alto, the encouraging thing is that we're able to pull 30% out of the costs, makes  significant improvements even with the furnaces in the condition they're in, so that's been the positive.

So, from our point of view, that's an important number, and cash  generation flows from those improvements. For those who do track back to what we talked about in 2013, the  underlying EBITDA improvement is $3.1 billion delivered against the targets, so we've done well against those  original targets and in fact, we've exceeded on most fronts.

The first thing I would say about South Africa is that we've restructured the business as  we have the global business and we've improved productivity in South Africa by more than 14%. We've reduced  our cost in the same sort of 30% range. We're learning from all parts of the business.

Grid parity is basically achieved when  the costs are competitive, or the PV-generated costs are competitive against coal or gas bio-generation."

It is the brain, the intelligence of the whole value chain, and it makes a huge  difference to the quality of an overall installed system out there.

There will be no one grid topology in the future. There will be a coexistence of  multiple topologies between micro solutions, nano solutions in the house, and the grid overall. They will coexist  and ABB with its wide offering is really a pioneer in that field. And we are well positioned to really articulate the  opportunities in this field in a fantastic way with our customers.

More than 1 billion people in  emerging markets today have no access to continuous electricity. The other is to support industrial and  commercial facilities that cannot afford the risks of power interruptions from conventional grids. We are already  very active in this small but fast-growing market based on our power conversion technologies, grid connection,  power management and automation capabilities.

As a result, base orders grew by 15% in local currencies, compared to the same quarter in  2009, and were 4% higher than Q1 of this year. At the same time, utilities continue to delay many of  their investments into power transmission, which is reflected in the 37% decline we saw in large  orders. Nevertheless, our order backlog is higher than at the beginning of the year, and revenues  declined more slowly, down 5% versus Q2 2009 in local currencies, than in any other quarter since  2008."

As a global market leader in EV fast charging infrastructure, we are proud to be a true  pioneer in e-mobility, and I would like to spend a few minutes on this today. This is one of our most exciting  market opportunities, as adoption of electric vehicles is substantially increasing around the globe. By 2030, an  estimated 24% of new cars sold globally will be electric. This is the equivalent of up to 25 million electric vehicles  being sold each year and a total of 100 million electric vehicles on the road in total. EV charging infrastructure will  grow exponentially with the number of charge points installed in a year expected to expand more than tenfold by  2030."

This quarter we had a positive impact from derivatives of about 80 million and a small  negative of 20 million for restructuring.

An area in which ABB demonstrates clear market leadership is EV charging, and  especially EV fast-charging infrastructure, a high-growth segment with excellent long-term prospects. Customer  demand is high for the integrated cloud-based charging solutions powered by ABB, that we manage in an  integrated way the flow of electricity, information, and funds along the electricity value chain towards the fleet of  electric vehicles. On this slide, we have provided an illustrated example of one of our solutions, the EV fast- charging station that we introduced at the Hannover Fair this year. This pioneering technology reduces the time it  takes to charge an electric vehicle down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes for a travel distance of more than 100  kilometers. The station is integrated into an EV charging network. This is entirely monitored and controlled  through the cloud to enable a user-friendly payment as well as proactive management of information on power,  fleet, and maintenance status. Moreover, it can be integrated with solar solutions and solar packages to provide  clean energy for charging up for clean individual mobility."

We have an installed base of more than 6,000-plus (sic) [5,000- plus] (23:38) charging stations worldwide, which will be soon 6,000, with orders for EV charging infrastructure in  the U.S., Europe, and South America. As one recent example, in September we signed a major order with an  energy company in Germany for 117 fast-charging solutions along the German highway. This comes on top of  previous order for 68 charging stations with the same company to supply our latest generation of fast-charging  stations which, through ABB Ability, are connected to the internet via our cloud solution and provide a fantastic  infrastructure along the German highways. As you can see, ABB remains the clear market leader in charging  infrastructure for electric mobility, both in Europe and the Americas."

First of all, we are in  a very lucky position today that having developed over the last decades a number of products,  which are highly efficient and really driving productivity; we have the market today, which is moving  to us. So we talk about climate change and we talk about environmental concerns. And in order to  address that concerns, we need more efficient and more productive products or solutions or  systems.

And also the business around  service, we today have in ABB an estimation of something like $170 billion of installed base in the  world. That means a lot of products to be maintained, to be retrofitted, to be upgraded, to be  improved, but also systems and solutions around that. So these opportunities, we need to tackle it  as well in ABB more than BU by BU. Why?

And having one, this has a higher wattage to it, but actually at the same time being  able to save energy on that is really critical from a customer standpoint going forward for that  specific market."

I really wanted to take you back  in time to say really it was the first quarter of 2010 where we first floated this issue to you. We took  about a $30 million charge at that point in time because of our contract renegotiation delay on a  cable layer contract as we put in place. As we moved into Q2\u201910 and also Q3\u201910, we had  unexpected seabed conditions, that just means we had committed from a terms and conditions  standpoint to bury this cable at a certain depth. We ran into areas that were geologically  represented where we thought wrongly in the contract. It was rock instead of mud, it was more  difficult to dig it, it slowed us down, and we had to address that and take these charges. As we  moved into Q4 2010, we had to \u2013 the new cable burial method we couldn\u2019t go deep enough, there  was rock something that we actually had to do with Power, rocks on top of the cable to protect it in  some way, which is significantly expensive in a lot of ways. Now look, these are accruals, it\u2019s not  cash out of the door. We\u2019re going to contend a lot of these charges, but from an accounting  standpoint if we feel we\u2019re going to take these charges going forward, we obviously have to accrue  for those and we have."

We booked now a $250 million charge, which was exactly the number we announced before  Christmas. And that charge includes also a few cost overruns on projects we have talked about in the previous  quarter including the offshore wind projects. It also includes additional costs we have taken to complete projects  in some countries where we had a high EPC content and where we are now reducing the capacity, as we will focus  on projects with higher content from ABB and lower construction-type content.  We have also completed quite a few steps of the program including changes to the tendering process, the risk  reviews, resources in contract management and claims, to make sure we have an organization in place to drive the  division in the right direction towards the higher returns. The new targets, as we already announced, for the  EBITDA margin corridor is now 9% to 12%, up from 7% to 11%. And we repeat that we are aiming to reach the  lower end of this new range by the fourth quarter of 2013 on a run rate basis. On the growth side, we reduced the  targets to 7% to 11% on a target basis from the 10% to 14% reflecting the higher selectivity we have on projects."

As you recall, our growth target is based on an assumption that  global GDP bottoms out in 2012 and 2013 before heading back up to the 4% range in 2014, 2015. So we're still  counting on that, we'll see that, that kind of economic growth would certainly be a tailwind for us and obviously  other people in the segment to make this work. We'll have to see how it develops in the meantime. On the margin  side, we're on track there, as you can see. EPS growth is behind at the moment, but we think we can come back as  the global economy recovers in the next couple of years. Cash conversion's in the green zone, which is really good.

Veli-Matti and his team, together with Pekka, have developed a ship propulsion solution, electric  propulsion solution for a ship. And the benefit for the customer is the propulsion set needs less space on the ship  so it can have more cargo and there's fuel efficiency of up to 20%. On a ship, more than half of the operating cost  is fuel. Cutting 20% out of that is a huge gain for the customers and we are very optimistic that this technology will  help us to drive growth by having attractive value propositions for our customers."

Developments succeed one another rapidly, such as some changing expectations, competition by fintechs and  open banking to name but a few examples. In addition, as society we're dealing with megatrends such as climate  change, the subsector economy and progressive aging population. Through all enduring topics, sustainability is  near and dear to the ABN AMRO and has therefore become an important part of our new purpose banking for  better for generations to come. And this purpose serves as a compass for staff to make the right choices and  decisions. We aim to serve the priorities of all our stakeholders. Customers want a painless customer experience.  Investors want attractive yields to safe and responsible investments. Our staff went to work for companies that  serve a clear purpose, and society expects us to consider the social impact of our operations in all our decisions.  In response, we have refined our strategy based on three foundations. The first foundation is sustainability. That's  an important pillar and always was. Sustainability is embedded in our work style, our customer financings and  investment services consider the environment, society and good governance. In addition, sustainability is a clear  business model. We aim to serve our customers in what may be the most important trend in the years ahead, the  transition to more sustainable products and business models."

First, we're well on track to achieve the \u20ac1 billion cost savings we  announced in 2016 and expect to achieve them by 2020. We've already cut costs by \u20ac700 million, and on  balance, our number of employees declined by 6% last year and reorganizations we do as carefully as possible  with our staff members pursuant to a good social plan. These cost savings are necessary in part to invest in  digitization, innovation and growth. We're working hard to complete our IT transformation ongoing digitization.  Customers do their banking at their convenience, for example, using the mobile banking app or adapting their  mortgage online. Nowadays, over 70% of all retail products and services are distributed via digital channels. I'm  also very proud, Tikkie. There are over 5 million users with over 200,000 ticks a day. So do a Tikkie has become  a household concept. In addition, we transfer the focus of the private bank in recent years to Northwest Europe.  We sold our operations in Asia and Luxembourg and last year we acquired SocGen operations in Belgium within  corporate and institutional banking we're focusing on improving the yield by reducing capital in certain operations  in sectors as indicator sustainability is an important spearhead for us. In 2017, we launched the Mission 2030  ambition to ensure that all homes and offices we finance to the tune of over \u20ac150 billion in residential loan  provided we own them by 2030 we want them to average an energy performance label A compared to the present  D label.

And risk costs were below what we expected last year, and we  can expect this to continue in 2019. A return on equity was 11.4%. That's right in the middle of the guidance we  issued of 10% to 13%. And in 2018, our cost income ratio also improved from 16.1% in 2017 to 58.8% in 2018.  And you know, their target for next year is 56% to 58%. This is the first time that the cost income ratio of this bank  is below 60%. The reported earnings per share is \u20ac2.35, and we're proposing a distribution of 62% equaling \u20ac1.45  over the 2018 financial year. This aligns with our policy of distributing 50% of the enduring profit and distributing  more if the capital position allows us to do that. So, the dividend yield for 2018 equals 6%, 7%. We think that's a  fine figure and we also achieved good progress in non-financial targets. Our efforts for our sustainability was  rewarded once again with a good score by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Another important topic is  diversity. The number of women in senior management increased from 25% to 28%. Employee satisfaction is up  to 80% in 2018.

Here you have to be aware that, as we already mentioned during the earlier quarterly  calls, that we have some accounting-related allocation changes between COGS and between OpEx. So, a shift of  some sustaining costs, especially in R&D and some costs in sales and marketing. And so to make it comparable,  this effect amounts to \u20ac11 million shift between gross margin and OpEx.

It's not as easy as you might think to quantify the impact of hurricanes. So we've done various analyses to try and  quantify it, all of which lead us to broadly the same conclusions. Looking at it simply, our year-on-year revenue  growth for each of the first four months of the year was an incredibly consistent 15%.

You'll mess up a lot of your  reconciliations if you class it as pure rental revenue with a lot of it being generators and cooling and setup.

For example, you can see a  screenshot there of our generators on rent in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands where we've got over 500  generators on rent with a further 350 ordered and on their way.

So  when I look at the fleet and revenue growth from our greenfields this year, around half was actually from transfers  from existing stores rather than being driven by new fleet. Similarly, some of the distinctions on costs will be  coming blurred as we optimize the resources of the maturing clusters rather than the individual locations.  Therefore, the key takeaways from this slide for me are that despite the high mobilization costs of the hurricane  activity, drop-through remains strong and encouragingly organic growth at a very healthy 13% reflects our ability  to continue to take market share."

But partly due to the timing of the events and partly due to the  geographies affected, we've generated $15 million of revenue from hurricanes this quarter as compared to $35  million last year.

Fleet on rent was up 15% and yield of 6% as we continue to benefit from the  structural changes in rental markets that we have discussed, despite a largely flat end construction markets. This  performance has undoubtedly been helped by favorable weather conditions, but also reflects the strong execution  of our operational plans. Once again, we are at record levels of fleet on rent and physical utilization from this -- for  this time of year."

As you can see from all three charts on page  six, Sunbelt enjoyed another very strong quarter, with rental revenue being up an impressive 27%.

Utilities also remained strong and with the industry defleeting, the short term  outlook is for broadly flat markets. However, the public sector now accounts for 40% of construction  and clearly there are reductions ahead. Potentially, these are much greater than the 8% currently  included in the CPA forecast for 2012. Historically, downturn in public sector is mitigated by an  improvement in the private sector. Again, given a general state of the economy, this has to be  considered as a potential weakness in the forecasts and we\u2019re therefore, more cautious about the  mid-term U.K. outlook. And let me clarify, I am not suggesting the end of the construction market as  we know it, as I have seen some commentator suggest. There will be pockets of strong activity for  example, utilities and energy, and the rental industry itself will correct itself by further fleet  reductions. However, the market must be viewed sensibly, and we will continue to look for greater  certainty before making any significant commitments in the U.K. market."

At least since 1999  we took 10 years and you had three efficiency programs, EOS, OPAL and GOAL. GOAL is the  project within ALMA. And you can see that we have improved actually the margin ratio, but there  was a sort of effect of natural gas on sales and costs. So if we exclude that, which as you know  doesn\u2019t matter in terms of profits, then we have the blue curve showing that we have constantly  improved the margin ratio from 17 to nearly 21%, which is an average improvement of 37 basis  points per year on a 10 year basis.

We have started up a plant like that in Italy last year, it took us only 1.5 months with  about 30 people to erect and commission this plant whereas it would have taken us I think about six  months, 70 people, in \u201895.

Those volumes increased as the price goes down, and we see  more hydrogen being sold to refiners because, as you all know, we need hydrogen to remove sulfur from the  shores.

And by the way, in our history, we've undergone, already  several times, oil crisis, and all those facts that we are talking about have been proved in the past when the oil  price was fluctuating."

At \u20ac2.2 billion, sales are up 12.6% year-on-year, with a 7% price effect reflecting the gradual  improvement in Acrylics and higher pricing in fluorogases, as well as the group's actions to adjust the selling  prices to higher raw material costs. The 3.1% net perimeter effect reflects the Den Braven integration and the  disposal of activated carbon and oxo-alcohol businesses."

Volumes are down 3.3% against last year on lower selling quotas in Fluorogases in  particular. EBITDA is up 10.7% at \u20ac165 million with EBITDA margin at 25.5%. This performance is once again  very robust and driven by the benefits from the F-Gas Regulation in Europe with slight normalization in PMMA  towards the end of the quarter and a robust performance of both Thiochemicals and Hydrogen Peroxide."

We launched restructuring programs, which are fundamental for 2010, primarily the  closing of a Methacrylic workshop in Carling in France, where we have excess capacity, and also  we had an excellent acquisition, the acrylic assets of Dow or part of Dow\u2019s acrylic assets in the  United States.

And if you look at the history of Arkema, in fact, we have had better results with high oil price.  So, I don't think there is a mathematic there and which is natural."

A lot of people are normally focusing  on one aspect of oil, it being either raw materials or customer effects that are taking place. Oil basically has  generally a positive effect on GDP, one that shows a significant reduction. So whereas, the GDP effects will likely  be positive, we, at AkzoNobel, of course, needed to, in detail, asses what happens to the individual end -user  segments.

We went from just under 100 people to zero in the quarter. And, of course, we also had  to realize some bad debts as we were closing down.

The demand continues to be weak in Europe and in  USA, especially, for new thermal equipment and this is due to the fact that because of uncertainty and current  insufficient reserve margin the customers continue to postpone some of their future projects. There are obviously  some exceptions. In Germany it's clear that the nuclear phase out will create new opportunities and when we look  at wind and service in general they continue to be robust.

So can you give me an explanation how I get to reconcile these two items?  It's very simple. We have a statistical outlier in here because the accident year loss ratio for the first quarter is  heavily impacted by weather-related claims in France and in Germany, a total of about 85 million to 90 million  that comes through tap water. Last year, we also had that, but in Germany it was in the second quarter not in the  first quarter."

Well, it is a great start of the year and  certainly the quarter multiplied by four gives a fantastic number, and I would be, as CFO, really delighted to  present this in three quarters, but I think we are really living in a very volatile world. There is on one hand the  usual weather events and other forms of natural catastrophes we just don't have under control, and we are the  market leader in P&C and cannot ignore this volatility. And on the other hand, yes, is a very bullish stock market  at the moment and it seems that the euro crisis is fully under control. But I think that is a quietness which I'm not  fully trusting and also the rest of our management team and therefore we feel that we have really to work harder  to justify any changes to the outlook, and that is what we promise as management team.

We had actually planned it as a second quarter event, but I  think the integration is so well advancing that we booked it in Q1.

And that is, in Germany, we had \u20ac150 million of winter and spring storms in  the quarter, so 1.9 percentage point cat loss compared to 0.5% last year. 1.9% is still light, but when I take all  weather-related events then we are at 2.8% in the quarter and that is roughly our normalized expectation for a  quarter.

Germany also had  2.4% and there will be more given the July hail storms.  Now despite of these things we had a 95% combined for the quarter. Again, let me repeat, we had not 80 basis  points, but 1.8% NatCat. There were a few miscalculations out in the market. That's what I'd like to point out. In  total, in the first two quarters, we had \u20ac1 billion of NatCat losses that we had addressed, and we are producing  these results despite this very, very high loading on NatCat.

So, it's  Fireman's Fund sale, altogether for our half year, a positive one-off.

So I would say the net increase quarter-over-quarter last year is about 60 basis  points, 70 basis points in underlying attritional loss, a number I would have not liked to talk to you about because I  was still confident that we could compensate the markets which obviously had a tough environment like Italy, the  credit insurance but also our large corporate business and our assumption was that the rest would make up for it.  But we are behind the curve, again, in our development in Latin America. So that is the main driver, I think, which  makes probably most of the 60 basis points."

Actually, to keep the story short, the underlying loss ratio in our calculation improved 1.7 percentage  points, compared to last year. We have a good improvement but that is hard to say whether it's normal. I think we  are at the moment at a relatively normal level of weather-related losses and large losses that is about the five- year average. So lower than last year. Last year, we were above the average, and cat is, with 1%, clearly below  our normalized assumption, but I think we are still on a very good level. What we don't like is development of our  expense ratio, yes, there are all these explanations why the expense ratio goes up, but I think that is where  Allianz will clearly spend even more focus on to drive it in the right direction."

We had a slight reduction of the  underwriting results, which was more than compensated by the improvement in the investment results. The  reduction of the underwriting results is explained by the combined ratio development where we see an uptick of  30 basis points. This uptick of 30 basis point is explained by the higher amount of natural catastrophe compared  to the prior period. Then you can also see that our expense ratio is significantly below the prior year level. So  usually you would expect to see also a better combined ratio compared to what we are showing here. But in the  second quarter, we had also a high amount of weather-related claims and large losses compared to what we  would usually \u2013 what we had last year."

My answer to the question will be yes. And the reason for that  is we've seen improvement in the attritional basis \u2013 in attritional loss ratio. If this improvement is going to carry- over and assuming we are going to have a normal level of natural catastrophe and large losses in the second part  of the year, we should be able to get to the 94% even considering for an increase or pickup of the expense ratio  back to our target level for 2018, which will be 28.4%. So as of now, we are slightly behind of the combined ratio,  but the attritional development is positive, so if everything continues the way we see we should be able to get to  94% by the end of the year."

There is one, the European windstorm Christian, which took place and  which is clearly a reality. So first estimates say \u20ac100 million but might also be a bit higher.

So, you get a little bit of a sense that there is a lot of  cushion even when the net harvesting is coming down. And our investment margin of 23 basis points is the  normalized level. This produced an investment margin of about \u20ac1 billion."

We're well-ahead of those targets, I  think it's safe to say that the last year, the Climbing New Heights strategy has not been a sleepwalk mode even  though we have reached our strategic result one year ahead of plan."

The earthquake that happened in 2011, as you well all have seen in the media, was a  devastating event for Christchurch. Christchurch is the second largest city in New Zealand and it not only had a  huge impact on Christchurch itself, but it had a huge impact on the country itself. And for a short while, going out  and purchasing hearing aids was not at the top of anybody's agenda. Obviously, Christchurch has taken a long  time to recover, and we have a number of clinics in Christchurch for both National Hearing Care brand and Bay  Audiology brand. They did suffer an initial decline, but I'm very delighted to say that through some operational  measures, we still have one clinic that has been unable to reopen and we've been able to manage the client  expectations and also get that business back on track in that part of the country."
