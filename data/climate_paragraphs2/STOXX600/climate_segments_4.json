Pilbara production was steady, running close to its nameplate capacity of  220 million tons per year throughout the year. Mesa A produced its first ore for the first quarter and  is now ramping up to a full capacity of 25 million tons per year. In July we commenced production  of the Brockman 4 and at the Western Turner Syncline extensions of Tom Price."

We saw reduction in underlying earnings from lower  mine copper production as a result of lower grades at Grasberg and Kennecott Utah Copper.  Refined copper production was also impacted by the 19-day planned maintenance shutdown at the  KUC smelter.

Moly autoclave should improve moly recovery  rates, should enable the processing of lower grade and provide entry to the chemical-grade moly  markets, and is an important part of the ongoing plans to extend the mine life of Bingham Canyon.  Eagle is a small but high-quality asset which will provide an excellent reentry into the nickel project  market. It will be the only primary nickel mine in the U.S. and the first new nickel operation to be  built in Michigan after several decades. These have been under some of the most stringent  environmental permitting rules in the U.S. Eagle is small but very prospective. It\u2019s in the middle of a  very prospective exploration region, and we\u2019ve got a very significant land and mineral rights holding  in the surrounding district."

At these prices, combined with continued elevated raw materials costs, approximately 25% of the smelting  capacity outside of China is in a loss-making position. Some smelter closures have been announced, but we've also  seen local governments, both in and outside of China, providing incentives to ensure loss-making smelters  continue to produce. This is preventing the rationalization of high-cost capacity that's required to balance the  industry. Given these circumstances we will continue our proved projects, including at Kitimat, AP 60 Phase 1 and  ISAL, but we'll be deferring further allocation of capital to aluminum smelting and refining projects for the  foreseeable future."

In Aluminum,  more than 50% of our products are value-added, allowing us to charge an additional premium.

However, we saw an improvement during the year  in most of our main commodities. Iron Ore started the year at around $40 a tonne, ended the year around $75 a  tonne. The average price was $53.60, which was 6% higher than 2015. Copper prices were, on average, 11%  lower than 2015, notwithstanding a 25% increase during the year. Aluminium ended the year 20% higher. But the  average was 3% below 2015, but market premia also fell. For example, the Mid-West premium declined by 40%  to $162 per tonne in 2016."

There are four key drivers that will continue to impact the iron ore supply/demand balance in 2017. The first is the  health of the Chinese economy, which I've just covered. Next, the Chinese domestic steel market is looking to  drive out high-polluting production. This is a clear opportunity for us as we will see demand switch from low-grade  ore to high-grade product we offer. The third, the additional supply from seaborne iron ore producers, we expect  about 40 million tonnes of new capacity in 2017. And last but not least, the domestic iron ore production in China  is a key source of uncertainty and could keep the balance."

This issue of pollution level is also not understood properly because pollution levels  vary greatly. For example, in local areas, let alone within urban centers; for example, indoor air quality is different  than outdoor air quality. It could be two times more pollution inside a tube station versus just outside one. Inside a  room or a car could be a very different level of pollution, air quality versus on outside."

But in many times, in a clear day, you might have a very high level of  pollution. And therefore, this measurement of pollution whether it's on a personal space or outdoors requires  monitoring and measurement. And then people can decide what to do with the protection that they need. So, first  in a range of city products is a sensor. Now, this sensor connects you to your [ph] stock (45:40) smartphone, and  constantly monitors air pollution where you are, indoor or outdoor.

I encourage you to see this extremely  interesting campaign for Air Wick VIPoo on your YouTube if you have time.

And the idea that others would walk in just after you  and smell something nasty is rather embarrassing. And VIPoo is not just a traditional post-poo spray. It's actually  a pre-poo spray.

It\u2019s very interesting  because it has a sensor device inside. Some of you can see it, a sensor there. And this sensor  basically tracks any changes in the chemical composition of the air. And when it does that, it  produces a burst of \u2013 a boost of freshness."

And I\u2019d like to introduce to you the Air Wick 100% Natural Propellant Spray. It\u2019s a new,  kind of a new generation, I would say, of aerosol products, because unlike traditional aerosols,  which are propelled by Butane and those kinds of products basically make the kind of fragrance  that you get quite artificial and sometimes very overpowering. This is propelled by 100% fresh air.  And that means that the kind of fragrance experience you get from these aerosols is much cleaner,  much fresher and overall when we put it in front of consumers, and I am sure you can try one at  home, because it\u2019s just hitting the U.K. shelves, you know this is a much, much nicer and much  cleaner fragrance experience. So we have -- this quite a nice product for daily use of air fresheners  and that\u2019s going into the market in the U.S. and in Europe and certain developing markets."

And what we are  doing is we have formulated a product, again, not an easy task from a technical point of view, which works as a  complete kitchen system. The kitchen system really here is that not only it cleans your dishes and therefore cuts  through the grease, but the foam also can be used to actually clean the kitchen surfaces and the foam is just the  right amount so that it does not cause streaking. So it's a pretty technically difficult thing to achieve this balance of  amazing grease cutting and right amount of foam, but also having no streaks on your surfaces. So it's a complete  kitchen system. It's a versatile product. It's a concentrated product. So the amount of product in every drop is  much more concentrated than the normal dishwash washing-up liquids that you find around Europe."

Now, I'm sure some of you can also agree with that.  But people think there's always going a to be trade-off between tough cleaning and safety, like if I give you  something safe, it could not be as good in terms of cleaning or the other way around. What we've managed to do is  to create a product with hydrogen peroxide as its centerpiece that allows consumers to have the same tough  cleaning that a bleach can give you without the necessary harsh chemicals associated with it. And what happens  here is that hydrogen peroxide when coming into contact breaks down into water and oxygen so it does not leave  any harsh residues."

And the third element of our vision on sustainability is the fact that we are an innovation engine. And if we  actually integrate our whole mindset of sustainability through our innovation, we will become a better business.  So we have undertaken to make one-third of our new products come from more sustainable ingredients. So it's  trying to embed in a very practical and important way this whole mindset of sustainability under this banner of  betterbusiness. And that's what we want to be, a better business in all ways.

In respect of  gross margin, as mentioned earlier and indeed as Liz signaled in July, the group delivered solid margin expansion  in half two after a decline in half one. This has been driven by a number of factors. Firstly, the group fully achieved  the Project Fuel cost savings program, which was targeting \u00a350 million in total and the largest part in half two.  Secondly, half two saw a more stable commodity and input cost environment. Thirdly, while volume and price mix  both continued to contribute strongly to overall revenue growth, half two did see a slight improvement in the  pricing environment. And lastly, of course, the strong growth in the health category helps gross margin mix and  offsets the slightly negative gross margin effect of the higher growth in emerging markets."

The way the ordinary  antacid works is by neutralizing the pH of your stomach acid, and that works quite well. The way Gaviscon Double  Action works is by doing the same. And then on top, what Gaviscon does is it creates this raft, this white raft that  you see on top. This raft comes from a very special ingredient known as alginate. Alginate comes from algae,  which is like seaweed, seaweed kind of floats on the top of water. This is highly concentrated, very well-sourced  product with great secret sauce in how we make it, which actually floats on the top of your stomach acid. This  means that you've neutralized the acid, but it also stops any chance of it coming back into esophagus. So,  Gaviscon has two actions. It lasts for twice as long as the ordinary antacid, so 2x mode of action, 2x duration, only  1.5x price. Therefore, great value, yet premium."

But you don't only have to compare hand dish and machine dish. You can also go within a category.  Take a category like air care. Air care, the aerosol that everybody will have in a bathroom, has a high penetration,  yet captive systems, like Freshmatic, or like oils, Electrical Oils, have a much lower penetration.

Example, on the CO2, I'll start  again in the top-left upper corner, the CO2 emissions so far, we have reduced by 4%. And fundamentally the way  to drive this is efficiency of the output to not waste material and the melting technology. For example, if you melt  with the electrical melt that is using renewable energy, that will have a lower CO2 impact. On the other hand,  melting with gas smelter instead of buying directly electricity from far away would also be better. So, we have a  strategy for how to improve this by at least 10% by 2022.

In  some markets, there are small startups that are making a business how to take this from a building site. And in  other markets, we have to do it more ourselves.

The top line had a few starts and stops, some places we have had a heavy winter, and we  saw some market grow tremendously. We saw others not grow at all. And this is what we predicted. The top line  is price and mix driven primarily. Then we look at the CapEx. We have invested what we expected to invest. And  it should also be said on the top line, that is the biggest sales we ever achieved in the history of the company in  Q1. So, we're happy about that. I think that's another sign that this fundamental demand for the product, I'm  talking fire-safe materials, natural materials and not made of plastics. It confirms that again the interest in stone  wool is high, and it keeps selling. And then if you look at the numbers, you can read them yourself."

So the biggest effect  regarding the decrease on the foundry coke, we have that already in the previous year. So what we see this year  has been the remaining part.

That's certainly not double-digit. It's not super booming all over, but  it's growing. It's growing, and Germany, for example, have high activity. So that's happening, but then in the  segmentation, the money primarily flows into plastic, insulation plastic foams and then glass wool and stone wool  and the mix is a bit different, but of course the plastic foam is the big segment and we see an increase in the  stone wool share. It's not dramatic changes all over, but you see an increase away from plastic foams to stone  wool.

On top of that the fire behavior and the fire performance of our product really  helps to make our products specified in airports. So, just an interesting development."

We have on top of that environmental costs of CHF242 million booked into that section,  and then certainly the write-offs of CHF367 million for the Nutley side."

In terms of end market, Gears benefited from the oil and gas activity as well as the  increases in the power, industrial and mining sectors. Margin was slightly impacted in the year due to the  investment in the new manufacturing plant in Leeds. The increased cost associated with the plant was offset to  some extent by the focus on reducing material costs, by developing the global supply chain. And there is further  work to be done in this area."

I think it's fair to say that  taking to account the dramatic decline in the oil price, the current climate has clearly become more challenging  especially in relation to oil and gas upstream investment. Some of this is due, I think, to the investment cycle of  markets such as U.S. shale being shorter. It is far easier to turn on and turn off a project related to oil and gas  production in shale than traditional oil and gas mega projects, and they'r e difficult to cancel once you have started  them."

First, we had a fantastic Christmas present which was the Pack C version of the compressible aids. The  new designs were certified, and the first airplanes with those new certified blades are flying now, which is good  because that's signaling an overall increase in the healthiness of the Trent 1000 fleet."

So, clearly to minimize disruption, we had to deal  with that one first. Trent 1000 TEN is the new engines going into service as we speak, and that's why logically,  that's the next one to deal with. And that compressor blade design is effectively the design bit is done and we're  now going through the process for certification. And the equivalent blade for the Pack B engines is coming along  behind that. And the reason that's coming along behind that is because there's a relatively small number of Pack  B engines out there. The incidents in the Pack B of the fault is much lower than in the Pack C."

It was a good year and that sort of thing's been  driving things like order intake. The reason I put the train up there as well is because we've been introducing long  term service agreements, taking the Civil Aerospace model into Power Systems and being successful in signing  up several of these long-term service agreements. All of that has driven volume and that volume has driven an  increase in operating profit."

We've  been demonstrating to ourselves and experimenting with the new composite materials around the fan and the fan  case, and also with the combustion system, the new lean-burn combustion system.

This will give us much more consistent operating  practices, as well as a good level of savings in our depots. And as I said, that should be really in place by the end of  Q3."

As a reminder, you can see all the fuel products for  Rubis, that represents 54%, so half of the revenue, minus 10% on that same period of time. And for other  products, we can see a strong increase and now represent 46% for chemicals, fertilizers, edible oils, and a 15%  increase, growth. So, here, there's a bit of a contrast. Fuels is decreasing, but all the other products are  increasing, a strong increase. For fuels, minus 23%, 8% are due to France depot, can be increased by the facts  that we manage our clients, their stocks, their positions, and that generates decreases in terms of flow, which  explains the reduction of this revenue."

I have already mentioned our decline in EBITDA and  operating result. Declining generation spreads and high burdens in the gas midstream business were determining  factors for the decrease in the operating result. I'll come to the details in a minute.  The non-operating result fell below last year's figures by about \u20ac200 million. One reason is the decrease in capital  gains compared to the first three months in 2011, which included the sale of Thyssengas and our minority stake in  the hard coal power plant in Rostock."

Before I move on to the other divisions, let me spend a minute on the development of the generation capacity in  Germany. As I understand, this is a burning question for you.

The earnings increase in the first three months is  mainly due to the positive development in energy trading which supported very high profits in the Q1 period,  which was partly offset by the negative earnings trend in Conventional Power Generation mainly due to the  decline in realized generation margins. Nevertheless, earnings contribution of this division is disproportionately  high in Q1 2016. Nuclear fuel tax and higher maintenance cost will come in the rest of the year. Furthermore, Q1  benefited from one-off gains from the sale of real estate."

Higher temperature and milder weather conditions compared to the previous year led to lower volumes, especially  distribution grid infrastructure. The earnings in our Sales business declined, among other things, due to lower gas  volumes from the back of milder weather conditions. For fiscal year 2011, we expect the operating result to fall  below the previous year despite the first-time full consolidation of NVV. This is mainly as a result of higher OpEx  for improving the quality of our Distribution Network business. The costs for refunding excess proceeds will be  slightly lower than in 2010. For the Sales business, we expect lower gas volumes, assuming normalized weather  conditions. Last year benefited from the cooler-than-average winter."

The increase is mainly attributed  to the improved operating performance of our Retail business, but also to some positive one-off effects. In the  Retail business, npower benefited from improved commodity cost management and growth in the segment of  larger business customers. In addition, our efficiency in cost reduction programs had a positive effect, in  particular on our bad debt position. The performance of our Generation business was supported by the  commencement of operation at our new CCGT plant at Staythorpe. Additional margins have been generated  despite some commissioning defects on two transformers that are currently reducing their production volume.  For full-year 2011, anticipate a significant increase in RWE npower's operating result, reflecting in particular RWE  npower's cost and efficiency programs.

Adjusted for ForEx effects, the division was down 8%. Pressure on earnings came from  weather-induced lower gas sales in the Czech Republic. Earnings are also impacted by lower margins in our  Hungarian business. One reason is that the Hungarian regulator reduced the allowed margins in the household  customer segment. The negative effects were partly compensated for by higher income in our Czech gas transport  business. For 2011, we expect the operating result to be below the exceptionally high number in 2010. In the Czech  Republic, we expect gas sales margins to further come down. The contribution from our Hungarian electricity  activities is also expected to stay slightly behind last year's level though less than anticipated.

After a drop in 2014 due to the termination of almost  2.5 GW of contracts, we  will see an increase in capacity in 2015 due to the commissioning of our hard coal-fired power stations in Hamm  and Eemshaven. These are our last two thermal power plant projects in the pipeline. From 2016 onwards, we will  start to see net capacity reductions in our conventional generation portfolio."

While EBITDA is down by about \u20ac1.6 billion, cash flows have increased by over \u20ac9 billion. This  discrepancy is mainly due to three reasons. Firstly, our earnings and FFO in 2013 already reflected the  approximately \u20ac1 billion, one-off payment from the Gazprom arbitration ruling. This is not the case with our cash  flows from operating activities. While the FFO include this in Q2 2013, it is offset by the same amount in working  capital as the cash payment only came in Q3 2013. Secondly, the repayment of nuclear fuel tax of approximately  \u20ac0.5 billion. After the Hamburg Fiscal Court decided in April now favor, we will refund the tax that we had paid  for our Emsland nuclear power plant. This is only cash flow relevant as within our P&L. We have to build a  provision from the nuclear fuel tax until we have the final court decision on the legality of the tax. We received a  decision for our Gundremmingen power plant in our favor from the Fiscal Court in Munich at the end of July. So  this is not yet reflected in our cash flow statement. Thirdly, cash flows improved due to high advanced payments  in the retail business as a result of price adjustments."

Typically, the certificates for the previous year have to handed to the  relevant emission authority in April of the following year; i.e. in 2013, we submitted the certificates for 2012 and  in April of this year, the certificates for 2013. With a change to the new regulatory regime in 2013 and thereby the  full auctioning of certificates, the number of relevant certificates has increased substantially .

And thirdly, a positive effect from  a reduction in provisions mainly pension provisions, which accounted for an improvement of \u20ac450 million. One  reason is that the discount rate for our German pension provision increased from 1.7% to 1.9%. Furthermore,  pension assets performed well and thus contributed to a decline in pension provisions."

Energy demand has stabilized in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the  beginning of this year already showed first signs of improving industrial activity.

I\u2019d like to highlight our prospects or answer  to 2011. 2010 has been a year during which we have started to grow again. Michel was mentioning  a turnaround or turning the corner and 2011 will make it possible for us to continue this  improvement all through the year. The economic outlook on our various markets are quite favorable  and we continue with determination our strategy to seize all kinds of new opportunities and services  and solutions in dynamic areas, like energy efficiency. It\u2019s a very interesting area for us and a very  interesting market and we have a strong position. Another interesting market for us is renewable  energy. We trust that volumes are going to go up in 2011 in order to support our organic growth  and we will continue, of course, to continue adopting an active external growth policy, particularly in  the high-growth markets."

So in the next section, I'm going to give you an update on the key business priorities for  2015 which, in a way, represent the main factors of execution for this year. First of all, as you can see on slide 24,  our strategic high-growth initiatives remain a key driver of profitable organic growth. And on slide 24, you  actually see the details by area. With respect to the key categories, energy efficiency which represents close to one- third of the overall high growth initiative sales continue to post strong doub le-digit growth at 19%. While  renewable energies increased by 15%, more than offsetting the drop recorded in 2013."

And we're going to further invest in commercial capabilities to  do so. In that respect, maybe important to mention is that next to the list you see on this chart, all key countries  have also developed their own specific local high-growth initiatives. So, we have complemented what we  articulated at group level with the specific areas of development in UK, for example, that would be facility  management; in Germany, it would be industrial solutions; and in France, we have developed a multi-energy  offer. In North America, it would be ESCOs and utilities and renewable energy. So, clearly, we're looking for  engines of growth and put a lot of emphasis on that."

So, the context is quite challenging. And in that context, we aim  at delivering in 2015 organic sales growth of between minus 2% and plus 2%, and adjusted EBITA margin of  between 4.8% and 5.2%; a solid free cash flow of at least 7 5% of EBITDA before interest and tax and around 40%  of EBITDA after interest and tax.

So, you'll see a dip in profitability in Q1, less so in Q2,  although that's subject to the yield outturn but any drop in profitability this year will be focused into Q1 and Q2.

As a combination of lower fares, our Always Getting Better program and cost control delivered strong  traffic and profit growth. Full year 2016 was a year in which we delivered significant traffic and profit growth in all  four quarters despite the fact that our average oil price which we had hedged in 2014 was just over \u20ac90 per barrel.  But our Always Getting Better program is attracting millions of new customers to our lowest fare, lowest cost  model."

But the real step change is going to come in 2019 when we take delivery of the  Boeing 7 37 Max Gamechanger aircraft. These aircraft have eight extra seats, will grow from 189 seats to 197 seats,  which gives us an opportunity to spread the costs over more customers, and to enhance our ancillary spend  opportunities.

We anticipate that the cost of risk will fall to 45 basis points and we expect TSB to have a neutral  contribution, excluding items such as potential fines or insurance recoveries but including costs for efficiency  gains. However, after Debbie Crosbie joins May 1, she will work on updating the TSB plan and the guidance will  be updated after this is finished. All of this implies that we should finish the year with a return on equity close to  7% and a core equity Tier 1 fully loaded at or above 11.6%."

Cost of risk continued its  downward trend in the quarter and currently stands at 51 basis points. As you can see on the left-hand side,  provisions have decreased significantly since the announcement of the institutional non-performing assets sales  in Q2 as we have started to accrue a good part of the savings. Overall, provisions were down by 22.5% year-on- year and are expected to fall further during the rest of 2019 as the credit conditions or that behavior of the  portfolios will continue to improve."

Fee incomes were more affected in some of the lines  of business, sometimes due to the environment or sometimes due to the strategy followed by the  bank to captured funds, which mainly affected those related to securities and mutual funds. In the  fourth quarter, I suggested that the most likely outcome was that this trend eased off, i.e., lower  growth in net interest income and a better evolution of fee income. And we\u2019re now starting to see  this in the first quarter, and we think that this will continue to be observed over the next quarters.  We think this trend will be repeated; i.e., at the beginning of 2009 the commissions went down 8%,  now it\u2019s at zero growth rate; points to the recovery of pension funds, securities and insurance.

We cut approximately 25% of  the portfolio on this day a year ago. And now a year later actually, I\u2019m actually pretty encouraged by  what I see as green shoots of growth and development coming in research and development. We  have gone through a significant reorganization because we are a Europe company. We\u2019ve of  course had to spend significant time on consultation with our social partners. That concluded  roughly towards the end of January and Marc has been rolling out a new organization, moving from  11 hierarchical levels to six.

The first aspect is really a macro element, and the  supply gap that we're seeing happening in the industry. We have seen a lack of investments in 2014. Supply gap  in the production of oil is projected. The question is not if, but when, and investments are being required. As a  consequence, we're going to see, and we're seeing more projects in the industry, and probably more projects that  the industry can handle."

What we are announcing today, though, is delay to the expected migration from the Lloyds \u2013  existing Lloyds Banking platform onto the new banking platform because we really want to make sure that the  transition for our customers is as smooth as it could possibly be. And hence, to get that right, we are delaying that  migration by six months to nine months. And we think that's a right thing to do from a customer perspective. The  consequences of that, though, in terms of our transition costs, if you remember last time at the prelims, we've  guided to a range of transition costs of \u00a3340 million to \u00a3380 million. We now expect the transition costs to be at  the top end of that range, so the \u00a3380 million."

So, the mix is a bit worse than it was in the fourth  quarter. When it comes to the bottom line, we have basically those effects from the price. We also have an  increased wood cost feeding through into the \u00d6strand result, which is offset by a better energy balance. So, we  are improving the energy balance in \u00d6strand."

When it comes to personal care, actually those three im provements have  made it possible for us to keep the operating margin at 11.3% in spite of the significant raw material headwinds  that we have also in this quarter. In personal care, we have a negative effect on the fluff pulp, from currency  mostly and the positive effect from the oil-based materials. But the positive effect doesn't outweigh the negative  effect in fluff pulp.

And the third  effect is also that we have had higher prices for wood in the third quarter which Forest paid for and they've not  been fully compensated yet by income from the industries because of this that we use an average pricing model  when we price between forest and the industries, which means that just three to six months' time lag that Ulf  mentioned."

Perhaps to give a face to all this growth, I put here on the right -hand side, you see a little  example of a specifically government-led program whereby the idea is to move from what they called new villages,  i.e., the former way to expand urban areas into small neighborhood. The idea is to create more livable space. The  idea is to allow people to have more areas, for example, for greenery. And that only can be achieved through  vertical construction. And that's why you see here, those evolutions, the growth from small houses into small  towers. And to give you an idea, those small towers are about 20 floors plus high. Very good.

And we do this through several actions. One is t he  head count cut with where we are on track. Second thing is, and this is long-term very important is the  streamlining of our processes. Just as an example, we are in a process of redesigning our process sales to  activation. We increased the efficiency through reduction of the call centers location from 14 to eight, so we are  also on track there. And also with the migration of All IP, we are on track. We are today at 40% migration of our  customer base. So, overall, on track here on our cost reduction program."

A good example here is the port facility at  the West Coast. These measures will reduce our operating cash costs. We also found that due to modifications and  optimizations of plant components, sustainable savings, for example, in energy consumption are achievable.

A relatively high level of capacity utilization at most potash producers and significantly  declining stocks led to price announcements from competitors for the Asian markets of U.S. $420  per ton for granulated potash. Brazilian market prices were announced between 410 and 420 per  ton of granulated potash.

Currently, the focus of our  daily work is dedicated to Phase 1 of realizing synergies of at least \u20ac150 million by 2020, and reducing our  indebtedness by 2023, we aim to achieve an investment grade rating again. It is of utmost importance to regain  financial strength in Phase 1 before we are able to start Phase 2."

As announced, I would like to begin with the Salt core business sector.  The past year saw an extraordinary high level of ice control business in Europe. Maybe you  remember that the winter of 2009/2010 had already set the new standards for the European  producers of de-icing salt.

The product mix in Potash nicely improved. However, we are still facing some challenges  at our Werra plant after the turbulent times and the trouble we had with our wastewater back in 2016."

On top of this, we have implemented a  new management team at the Werra, and we are once again hiring people to strengthen our workforce. At the  same time, the decision to close down Sigmundshall by the end of 2018 was not easy for us, but diminishing  volumes and vanishing profitability triggered this step. Last but not least, we have taken the first important ramp- up step at Bethune."

With  the KCF commissioning, which reduces our wastewater by another 20%, we are pretty optimistic that there's only  a very limited risk of further outage days in the Werra region."

Volumes in the final quarter were up on last year's achievements, driven by good demand from chemical  customers in Europe as well as higher industrial salt volumes in Latin America. However, the average selling price  of \u20ac110 per ton in Q4 was below last year's level due to adverse currency effects but also on the back of further  improved copper-leaching activities. The profit contribution of copper leaching is remarkable, but low pricing has a  softening impact on our average portfolio price. Our de-icing business reported a tangible volume increase in Q4.  Overall, the mild weather in North America was more than compensated by Europe, again, a nice proof of our  regional hedge. Prices in de-icing were down as expected. This was mainly due to the inventory situation in North  America at the end of last year's winter season."

In Salt, we shipped more than 3 million additional tonnes as a result of the harsh winter at  the start of 2018.

So, you can see that number coming in positive inflows in the UK. EMEA, we saw an outflow, \u00a31.6 billion on the  Institutional side, predominantly actually Middle East, which we count as Europe, and there was this \u2013 another  outflow in Nordics. The more important number there though is on the Intermediary side, which was \u00a34.5 billion of  outflow, predominantly in those countries which are dominated by risk of environment. So particularly, the two big  markets which contributed to that was Switzerland, where obviously the big GFIGs are based and Italy. We did  positive flows, particularly in Germany, which was very pleasing and it's an important market for us, reflecting a  little bit of work on private asset."
