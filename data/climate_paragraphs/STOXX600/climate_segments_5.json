Certainly to be  remarked is the growth in the core business with CHF 79 million or 5.9% year-on-year. The non-core business of  division Electronics, also known as titanium inserts, is shown separately with the red bar. It accounts for a sales  reduction of CHF 53 million. This business is now down at $21 million and the maturity of it will probably run out  this year."

To overcome  these capacity shortages and also to support further growth, the capital expenditure is expected to increase again  towards 6% to 7% in this year, 2017. The development of net working capital, both as a percentage of net sales  and days outstanding, is rather stable with 31% and 114 days, respectively. There's really nothing else to report  on the net working capital."

We invested really in high growth countries, and we invested about \u20ac1.1 billion energy efficiency,  that's about \u20ac900 million. And then we also consolidated our strength in Building Distribution and Construction  Products, and basically in Distribution actually, to about the extent of about \u20ac300 million. So as we told you at the  beginning of the year, we would start reinvesting, and that's what we did."

Firstly, the trend in  volumes with the positive effect that you're all familiar with for the first quarter, linked to the positive weather  conditions we had compared with the negative conditions in the first quarter of 2010, but if you look at the  following quarter that are more significant. As I told you, there'd be a negative impact in the number of days in the  fourth quarter, but if you restate those figures on a comparable number of days basis, you have a growth of 1.7% in  the second quarter, 1.7% in the third quarter and 1.3% in the fourth quarter. So no substantial important trend.  Besides kind of slowing down, December was a favorable month, but it was a small one."

And this is a  priority for us in our strategy, as we told you before, and this strategy is now panning out.

And if you look at the variation  compared to last year 2010, with 5% of growth in revenues but 2.7% of growth in prices which were not totally  sufficient to offset the raw materials and energy price hikes, so the 2.3% of growth in volumes plus the leaner cost  base that we've set up enabled us to increase our operating income by 11%, so it's a good operational leverage."

Excluding distribution and in distribution, we see that we're still at 11% of  volumes below 2008. The price in the period over the three years, the prices enabled us more or less to cancel out  the strong inflation of raw materials cost and energy prices. So the drop in costs we fully off \u2013 the drop in volume  rather, we fully offset by our other measures which were the leaner cost base measures.

That can be explained by the shrinking of the solar markets that were  present in Flat Glass, of course, and the slowing down of certain emerging countries in a situation where Europe  remains difficult.

This covers Western  Europe and Asia and the emerging countries. The solar business had developed as you will remember quite  significantly, but the markets really collapsed here in Europe in the course of 2012. And things have been  extremely difficult there given the activities from Chinese producers. All this affected the construction business,  and we've had, as I said, problems in the automotive market as well linked to this, linked to a falloff in demand.  We've also seen a fall in the float glass prices, which has gone hand-in-hand with an increase in September and  October.

And so we're sticking to our  schedule, to our targets, and we will execute the whole operation when the right time comes. And I'm not in any  terrible rush to do this given the financial conditions, which are ahead of us for 2013.  Second strategic thrust I want to talk about is constantly adapting to the economic climate. And given that climate  we have to adapt very swiftly and very strongly to ups and downs on our markets while maintaining strict financial  discipline. We've done all this, of course, over the past years. If you look over the past 20 years, what we've done,  we have always been capable of pushing our prices up when there's been fall-off in volume with the exception of  2009, 2012 for flat glass as well.

First, there is a change in the respective role of the various players, of  the key decision makers in the construction industry. And this is boosted by the digital evolution. Globally, the  user, the final user is much more involved. The boundaries between the final users, what is called also B2C  approach and the traditional approach, are reshuffled to some extent with digital with the user focusing more and  more as growth and well developed on making sure it gets more comfort in many areas whether it is acoustic,  whether it is thermal \u2013 it's more thermal comfort than energy savings \u2013 whether it's visual.

Operationally, I think we've delivered good results despite what is clearly a  very challenging macroeconomic climate. And we're very pleased to have EPRA earnings up just over 5% for the  half year. Secondly, since the strategy announcement in November last year, we've made some very encouraging  at this stage in the process. We have taken some further write-down in terms of NAV, largely as a result of the  lower valuation of the Neckermann site and the other large non-strategic assets, which I think reflects the  relatively illiquid nature of such assets in today's difficult market environment. So more encouragingly, the core  portfolio has performed well, both operationally and in terms of capital value, and those core assets now represent  81% of our total portfolio compared with 69% when we announced the strategy. So overall, I'm pleased with the  progress we're making and I think we're well on track towards our goal of becoming a leading income-focused  REIT."

But to highlight a few key points, I think we've made a solid first half or  had a solid first half in terms of leasing and lease renewals with 171 deals in aggregate signed during the period.  Our retention rate has been pretty good at 63% and nearly 70% in the core portfolio. We've held the vacancy rate  flat at 9.1%, just down from the position at the end of the first quarter. And we've managed to increase our like- for-like net rental income on the existing assets by 1%. The development program is continuing to build, and I'll  touch on that separately in a few minutes. And finally, we've achieved further cost savings and are making  operational improvements in several areas of the business such as in our management of cross-border customer  relationships, sustainability and property management systems, all of which will help to drive future efficiencies  and performance improvement going forward."

It has a very  good customer list. It's well managed. And we're maintaining and indeed growing income with an improvement in  the vacancy rate from 23% at year-end to 16% at the end of June in a local market where there has been weak  demand and over-supply. Energy Park in Milan is a very attractive out-of-town office development site where  fully occupied.

As we've previously explained, there are some powerful long-term  structural tailwinds behind occupier behaviors in our markets, most notably, urbanization and the technological  revolution. It's clear that more and more people are choosing to live in cities. This creates pressure to build more  homes often on land previously allocated for industrial uses, which is why we keep banging on about the loss and  the diminishing supply of such industrial land. But these growing urban population centers also push up demand  for goods and services, which require warehousing and large industrial space leading to strengthening demand  for such urban property. And this demand is being supercharged right now by e-commerce, which increasingly  needs space close into the final consumer for last-mile delivery. This can only intensify in the future as pressures  mount to use greener delivery methods in order to reduce vehicle emissions. These are some of the forces which  are driving up rents and land prices and which are leading developers and planning authorities to look at greater  intensification of use, in other words, multistory."

Suitable buildings  and development sites to provide these requirements are hard to find especially in urban locations and planning  processes are slow and difficult to navigate which inevitably puts a break on new supply coming through. These  demand drivers and the supply constraints in many markets will we believe continue to provide a structural  tailwind for good quality well-located assets and landholdings for some years to come."

One of the unique \u2013 one of the features of this combination is the  independent service or independent data evaluation or data validation.

So in so doing, they give us the responsibility for  moving products in their plants and their terminals, and we take it from there, again, continues to grow  significantly. The margin was impacted. As you know, we had some refinery closures here in Europe. We also had  some refinery closures in the Caribbean. And of course, because the upstream sector is brand new to the SGS  Group, we had some initial establishment costs that have in fact impacted the margin.  All of our existing businesses will continue to grow. And Aleem? We have a training session and his answer is \u2013  everybody just says or if I say, they won't grow, will they not? But some of the new innovative services \u2013 Aleem  and his team have developed this thing called the attic. Is it a big concern? I think it's about a poet sitting on top of  an attic, somewhere writing poetry. But in fact, this [indiscernible] (24:11) Advanced Technology Innovations  Center, which we've established in Houston. These are a group of gentlemen, very highly qualified engineers who  are allowed to play with toys and money, and they invent things. They invented the [indiscernible] (24:26), the  [ph] mini gor (24:27) that we talked about historically. And the most recent innovation they have come up with is  the thing called [ph] Gaspro. (24:34) You'd be crazy if \u2013 or if you don't read the newspapers, unconventional gas \u2013  shale gas, coal bed methane, all of these new forms of gas are obviously of significance. I mean the U.S. economy is  converting 70% of their coal-fired power station to gas, and they're getting the gas from these unconventional  sources. The [ph] Gaspro (24:56) attaches to the source as it comes out of the ground. It analyzes the quantity and  analyzes the quality of the gas as it comes out of the ground before it goes into the utility."

Other than that I won\u2019t go too much in the detail, as Chris will be going business-by- business through the performance. I would like to highlight and I will in a second, that in the second  semester, all the businesses had the orange part of the graph, i.e. the organic growth, on the right  hand side. So this is really full year agri, industrial and environmental, did a good effort of  recovering in the second half and you will see quite a difference between H1 and H2."

Life Science that was the acquisition M-Scan which is a group of company in four  locations which came in in the autumn, and Chris will come back on that because it\u2019s a very  strategically important acquisition for the Life Science. In Industrial, six acquisitions and quite  interestingly three in the Asia part of the world with KCQT in Korea, AST in Australia and HJEL in  China; and three in Europe with INTRON in the Netherlands, Am\u2019Tech in France, and one in  Switzerland, Atest that came in, in December, so very last addition to the year. Environment, that\u2019s  EKO-PROJEKT that was actually acquired at the end of 2009, but it\u2019s on a 12 months rolling basis,  so you see an impact this year. So all in all, a contribution of 09% this year but with clearly a big tail  to it given that the 10th acquisition hasn\u2019t given any topline yet."

We had record soil samples, crop research really  took off. The only thing that really pulled this business back \u2013 the only things that pulled this  business back were the contraction in traded volumes, and that was basically throughout the entire  year, and then of course, come August, Russia put on an export ban and the Ukraine decided to  have export quotas."

As you probably know, the Itraxx index shows  the average CDS spread for the 25 largest and most liquid European bond issuers in the banking  and insurance sectors. And in my view, this is a very relevant indicator of the degree of financial  disorder in Europe. As can be seen in the chart, the Itraxx index remains volatile at historically all- time high levels, indicating a significant uncertainty in the funding markets. On the contrary, you can  see our CDS spread stabilizing at very low levels in comparison to the market. And since some  time, we now in fact have the lowest CDS spread of any comparable European bank."

A major step  forward was the decision of the department for transport in the U.K. to select Siemens as preferred bidder for a  1,200 new rail carriages on the Thameslink route.  For the sector Energy, we continue to see a slower pace for the entire market during the second half of our fiscal  2011. Nevertheless, book-to-bill for the sector, again, stood at a very healthy 1.18; also sustained its outstanding  project execution performance, combined with a favorable business mix of high margin products and service  business and achieved an underlying margin of 22.6%."

Since  market conditions continue to be highly volatile for an IPO, we decided to pursue a spin-off to our shareholders as  the most probable part of divestiture. This option requires shareholder approval at the next AGM in January 2013  and Siemens still intends to remain an anchor shareholder in OSRAM. Though our strategic intent remains the  same from an accounting perspective, this results in a significantly negative non-cash P&L effect in discontinued  operations through a so-called cumulative catch-up of depreciation and amortization related to OSRAM.  For the record, here is the overview of the key figures for the third quarter. These challenges are reflected in our  regional split of orders and sales in the third quarter, the lack of large orders, particularly in Energy and the Rail  business, compared to a strong prior-year weighted on growth rates in Europe and also the U.S. Major driver  behind the 28% order decline in the U.S. was the expected expiration of the U.S. tax benefit scheme on  renewables, which led already to a sharp decline in new Wind orders."

And then, of course, you can make big reports and say  how bad the situation is and that you have no chance to sell and so on.  Instead, our people secured the supply chain, so they were renting a warehouse on a hilly area, so they could  secure the supply. And, at the same time, they were preparing a new special product package to repair the  damaged factories. And we're starting to visit all our customers, for example, the large Nestl\u00e9 factory, which was  under water and they were doing so by boat. So they were going to these thick industrial parts and visiting our  customers who were struggling with the situation and offering repair solutions for the damaged factories."

And I think we already referred to this  last year for kettles, for example."

That could also be one reason why it's going to be going over more towards PPPs. So, it's not only  because of the financing side, but also the capacity of design side because if you go with the PPP project, then  you move to design work over to the contractors. And that is also, like, you can say that's one reason to also  move over projects with a PPP setup. So, we believe that that could also boost an increase to PPP market in the  U.S. Otherwise, we see some projects coming in UK and there's also been announcements of some infrastructure  projects in Norway."

Now, back to the financials and let me first start with demand development. For the group overall, our volume was  somewhat similar to the first quarter and down nearly 3% year-on-year. But again, we had a different picture  around the world, with our sales developing positively in the Americas, both North America and Latin America  showing very good growth, up over 8% and 16% respectively.

In Asia Pacific, we had very  strong growth in China, very, very strong growth in China in the fourth quarter, driven by three specific  businesses. Generally, our business was okay, but three specific businesses. Renewable energy, we saw a good  recovery. Remember in renewable energy, we've gone through a couple of years of very low business in China. And  so there was some restatement because there'd been a lot of destocking taking place, and so we had some recovery  in that, partly due to the end of destocking and partly due to the market."

Farm and forestry was down for us in the fourth quarter in total, but also mining and  infrastructure was down in that timeframe. Distribution, relatively unchanged in total in North America.

And also, the Chinese New Y ear is becoming an  increasingly important impact on the Chinese business. What went from being, some years ago, being one week  has spread out to being two weeks, and more like two and half weeks in terms of impact the re. So we think that  means it will still have a sequentially somewhat level business, we won't see the same momentum.

We were slightly above what we announced in October, so we've accelerated growth in Q4. And this is  something important because you will see within the digital context, we're doing changes in business models.

I mentioned during our last call a range this year of minus 10% to zero organic growth. I can now  narrow the range to minus 5% to zero. Nuclear activity is line expectation with solid margin. The organic  contraction as anticipating reflects the ramp down of the EPR contract.

Sales from metering and services increased at a pace above segment  growth as our Asian customers increasingly make investments to reduce their energy usage and lower carbon  emissions.

This is when the Swiss National Bank de-pegged the Swiss francs against the euro. And you remember  what happened to Swissquote. So some of our clients went negative on their accounts and we had to provision  these negative balances by a provision of CHF 20 million.

These  numbers are unchanged from the figures we\u2019ve given earlier in Q2. Obviously both of these losses  also impact the combined ratio where we\u2019ve suffered excess nat cat [natural catastrophe] losses,  but here the impact is only about two points more than we would normally expect in the quarter,  and the remainder of the loss is in excess of expectation. Essentially it comes from Deepwater; you  can pick any of the items that contribute to the excess loss on the liability side, but this is obviously  the most significant. Underlying we believe we\u2019re tracking in line; and Deepwater, and this will only  be about eight points.

And  during the end of June or Q2, the inventories in the North American service center system amounted to roughly  2.7 months of supply, which is somewhat lower than normal given the season."

According to World Steel Association, the  global crude steel production increased with 8% during the first six months of this year and amounted to almost  760 million tons. And following a healthy April and May, demand growth slowed a bit in June in Europe, and that  was due to uncertainties regarding the macroeconomic situation in combination with the seasonal decline that we  see every year. During the latter part, spot prices of strip steel of Q2 \u2013 spot prices of strip steel fell and plate prices  held up better but started to weaken a bit or somewhat in the U.S. and China by the end of the period. But it's clear  for us that the recovery continues and the demand for 2011 is expected to be higher compared to 2010."

This is a Finnish container company called  Ferreus. They have yet to become a certified member of SSAB's Hardox In My Body family. They have together  with us developed a new container where they were able to reduce the weight of the container with 1 ton, and that  is approximately 25% in weight. They've also been able, with this new construction, to increase the lifetimes of the  container with 3 times. The container is much cheaper to maintain due to less weldings and less reinforcements  and also cheaper to produce. So this is a typical example, but the payback time for the container owner or the  container user is very, very short to invest in these kind of containers, including Hardox."

And I actually read a quote from the chief architect from that firm and  he said that, he hoped that \u2013 he said it was a fantastic, rough and tough material, and he hoped that somewhere in  the future he would able to make a sculpture out of Hardox. So, that is a different way of using our products, and  as said, the first example is maybe a more common example."

For iron ore, it's actually been \u2013 the spot market have been unusually stable during Q2 and actually so far into Q3  as well at slightly below $65 per tonne. What we have also done in the quarter is that we have signed a new  agreement with LKAB, so from April 1 this year up until end of March next year.

So,  the only emissions that will come out of this process is pure water. And if we are successful with this, we will be  able to take away 10% of the Swedish carbon dioxide emissions and more than 10% of the Finnish carbon  dioxide emissions. But we will also be able to sit on a lot of valuable IP for a completely new way of producing  steel. So, that was according to me, at least, and according to SSAB the most important event during the second  quarter.

The loss of customers in GB outweighed the gain in Ireland.

Marchant  Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Scottish & Southern Energy Plc  Thank you, Alistair, and good morning, everyone. The purpose of our wholesale business is straightforward; it's to  sell source and produce energy for our customers. The environment in which we do that job is however becoming  increasingly complex for four key reasons. First, UK gross imports of natural gas now exceeds gross production for  the first time since the 1960s. That means there's even greater integration of the UK energy prices into the wider  global market and macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are increasingly important. Second, global demand for  gas and coal continues to rise. The IEA is forecasting increases of 65% and 25%, respectively, over the next 25  years. Third, renewable energy and the climate change legislation at EU and member state levels continues to  have a profound effect on electricity production and public quality development. And fourth, everyone appears to  expect the tightening in the electricity capacity margin in the UK as older plant is forced to retire. The questions,  however, are when and at what rate."

Our dividend plan reflects our commitment to realizing the  significant opportunities we see to create value in an energy system that is changing rapidly. First, a decade on  from the Climate Change Act, the momentum behind decarbonization appears unstoppable with a focus on clean  growth, supported by public policy and falling renewables cost. This presents opportunities for SSE as a leading  generator and developer of renewable energy. We've already cut the carbon intensity, the power we generate by  50% and we have a new ambition for a further 50% reduction taking it to around 150 grams per kilowatt hour by  2030."

So, in the 2015 and prior period, we have typically been investing  below $1 billion a year. We have on average boosted that by around half, last year was actually $1.6 billion. But I  think, more noteworthy, is the proportion of that that is actually on things that are tangibly improving the  businesses. So, in the green on there, you can see that back in 2015 about $0.3 billion was on things that were  improving the business rather than sort of regulatory projects. That $0.3 billion has now moved to $0.9 billion. So,  we have tripled that over that period of time."

On the line other, we were down $22 million, as explained already on the previous slide, Bergvik and  Tornator being the main contributors to this change.

From the negative side, fibre costs increased by 72  million when we include the purchased pulp. Other variable costs like transport and chemicals  increased by 53 million and fixed costs by 23. We expect cost inflation to increase up to 2% for the  full year, driven by wood, transport, and chemical costs. This however, includes the purchased  pulp. And if we would net the whole pulp position, our cost inflation would be close to zero."

The operational EBIT of \u20ac184 million, yes it was better than guided and  what we expected in July when we gave the guidance essentially driven by strong performance in Renewable  Packaging, which is both cost, a bit also revenue driven, and also Building and Living segments bouncing back  through their cost improvement program that they started in late 2012."

But then I think it's important to try to describe also that two of our segments  namely Renewable Packaging and also Building and Living, they're seasonally both a bit different than the others  meaning their fourth quarter and if you look at that in Renewable Packaging as example, they make between 80%  and even 90% of their year-to-date profits in the first three quarters and also Building and Living is a bit more  seasonal than the others."

We came in with Renewable Packaging for the third consecutive quarter with a strong performance, and  quarter-on-quarter, the operational EBIT increased compared to the period a year ago by 30%. Biomaterials  improved their performance despite the ramp-up, and what that means in Montes del Plata, Building and Living  came basically in on a similar performance as last year, and we had a stable performance in Printing and Reading."

It\u2019s not that the environment has gotten easier; I mean demand may have  gotten a little easier, but the pricing pressures have increased. We hope that the cash flow, the cost  and the balance sheet are proof points of that to you. More important, strong is that we\u2019re  improving. We\u2019re not done, our cost base will improve further this year, and my simple message to  my own people this morning was now that we\u2019ve practiced for three years, including myself, maybe  we should finally start putting the gas pedal down and get some more speed. Why? Because we  want to be able to invest into our future, which then has to be profitable on a totally different level  than our past and I repeat fiber-based backed, cheap low-cost pulp as being one of two of the key  areas."

Now, I'm going to go through the review of this first half and first go to the headlines of the main achievements of  the first half. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we've been totally focused on execution \u2013 operational  execution. In the first half, the main achievements have been, first, pricing power; price increases by \u20ac141 million  in H1 and I'm going to come back to that. But with that, we have covered 80% of the raw material impact that  affected us last year. Then operational efficiency, our adjusted operating result, adjusted EBITA increased by 9%;  the earnings per share plus 10%. Our cash generation is back to a normal profile after a disturbed 2011 year. And  the free cash flow over the last 12 months is equivalent to 108% of our net income."

In this business, we have been also selective with projects of building controls. So, if  you focus on the low voltage product parts, we have been actually growing quite well, I would say around 3% for  the total of the company on a worldwide scale, which is a great performance in a place which is our area of  excellence on a global scale."

Remind you that the tremendous success of Schneider is what we  do on the home, on small buildings segment which is a segment we've been consistently developing and growing  in the past years, on the back of acquisition, we did long time ago that we have now consolidated and that we are  boosting with a lot of innovation, a lot of new products."

This is getting accelerated by the digitalization of what we do.

Very strong traction in data centers and network which as a segment for  Schneider is growing double digit totally. So that's a very strong dynamic. I'm going to come back on it afterwards.  Industrial and infrastructure, there, again, double digit, very strong there, with a mix of \u2013 not double digit \u2013 double  digit on automation, with a mix of 50/50 between Energy Management and Industrial Automation on utilities,  which is mostly a Medium Voltage play complemented by Low Voltage.

But the problem we had is that some of those business that we had acquired were  not profitable enough respect to what we want to have in Energy Management. So, we've been constantly  working on the improvement of profitability of Medium Voltage and we scored another year at 130 bps, it's actually  400 bps of improvement over 3 years and which makes that now this activity is solidly anchored above 10% of  profitability, more convergence in terms of profitability with the rest of Energy Management.

So, North Sea has been very active, but we also  won our first award in Mexico and order flow improved in West Africa. One trend to highlight is a growing  importance of technology. We are demonstrating ourselves to be one of the key technology leaders in the Subsea  industry and our ability to develop and implement new technologies plays a key role in contract awards. For  example, the Aasta Hansen project represents a number of firsts in the Norwegian Continental Shelf in terms of  water depth and technology solutions. The project will see the installation of the first steel catenary riser in the  Norwegian Sea and also the installation of mechanically lined pipe by drilling. This metal is a very cost-effective  pipeline technology that Subsea 7 has developed together with Butting and forms a part of the technology  development program for pipeline and riser system that puts Subsea 7 in the forefront when it comes to complex  field development projects."
