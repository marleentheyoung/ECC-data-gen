The complexity of the current  environment and the potential difficulty in connecting customers with strong growth opportunities naturally benefits  the bank with our network and heritage. The world is evolving into big regional trading blocs with less global trade  but vastly increased regional trade, and the areas where barriers are falling fastest are the regions where HSBC  is strongest. A long-standing and growing strength in infrastructure and project finance in Asia and Europe also  positions us perfectly to capitalize on opportunities arising from the China-led Belt and Road initiative and the  rising prominence of green finance."

So, therefore, the  cost is primarily in the operations items which are related to investments, machine moves,  consolidation of the  warehouse, it's similar."

Actually, we are quite pleased with the quarter to end up  with an operating margin which is equal to last year, Q1 which was a good quarter, it's a good result for us, and  you will be aware that there has been some headwinds this quarter, talking about the weather, of course, and  what is particular about the weather this year quarter one is that it has been cold both in Europe and North  America. So, I'm talking North America particularly the East Coast, Midwest has been truly cold. Europe is pretty  much across quarter one, even stretching a little bit into Q2, but not in any significant way. Despite that, operating  margin remained at 11.2%, which is good. And we have seen now the three divisions in profitable growth  continuing that trajectory of improvement of our earnings, EBIT, and margin. So, that is quite pleasing. At the  same time, we have faced quite considerable headwinds with the Consumer Brands Division, and I'll come back  to talk a bit more about that."

Remember  the 12% of those being acquisition-driven, and we're talking about the Pullman Ermator primarily it's doing  fantastic, HTC, and then now lately, Atlas Copco Light Compaction. And where we have said that there is no  significant EBIT component related to the Atlas Copco acquisition for 2018, so there might be, let's say, a little bit  less than half of those 12% related to acquisition that goes to \u2013 allocated to Atlas Copco. And that doesn't bring  any margin content. So, you could say there is some margin dilution, maybe in the magnitude of half a percentage  point here due to the Atlas Copco top-line, and result contribution. Positive development particularly in Europe,  actually where we rarely see the correlation between weather and construction, and of course, in Gardena, we  actually have seen it, and particularly North America, where there has been delays of some projects in the quarter  East Coast, Midwest, but where we expect that to pick up again in quarter two. So, it's more a delay between  quarters than anything about the underlying pace that has changed. We still see a good momentum in the  underlying business in all geographies actually. 11.8% margin was increased to 11.9% margin than \u2013 okay, I think  with that, I leave the divisional comments and let Jan talk more into the details of the financials."

I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that last year quarter three was \u2013 we had a prolonged season  in North America compared to an average season on one hand, and we had a drought or a high pressure that  stayed for quite some time over the Continental European space during July until August last year, which led to  over average water sales. So compared to a more average season, we had two things that stood out positively in  quarter three last year, and what we've seen so far from the start of quarter three, it's more like an average quarter,  and I do not have the visibility of how the total quarter will look like."

The benefits in 2013 will be savings of SEK160 million  before we get the full annual effect of around SEK220 million for 2014. The cost, SEK256 million, was charged to  the fourth quarter 2012.  And then over to slide number five, financial highlights. Here we focus on the fourth quarter, which as I said  earlier, was impacted by a weak macroeconomic environment and demand all over Europe, as well a huge impact,  especially the second half of the year when it comes to weather-related, both in Europe as well as America. For  Americas, in Construction, the development was stable. Group EBIT for the quarter substantially lower than  previous year, mainly impact by cost for the staff reduction program as well as the downturn in Europe."

Remember, it's very important how the  pattern of improvement in fuel costs is going to be accelerating in the next quarters. We said Q2, and that has  been a headwind that we have been going through in this quarter. Because of the way the hedges were unwinding  through the calendar year, Q2 looked not very good, and in fact it had, in terms of hedging dollar, a negative  impact against us. We thought it was going to be 4.2 or so it has been about 3. So a plus 3 instead of a plus 4.2 or  so we forecasted last quarter. But this is getting better and better through Q3, Q4 and then the following year. So  you see Q3 we are getting into again positive, so positive means saving territory, minus 5% savings in unit terms."

The high-fuel  and high-inflation environment puts this particularly in focus.

It has to do with these  new initiatives that we are undertaking across the board in the different companies, especially this time, British  Airways and Iberia, and that will be rendering benefits already, I would say, through Q3, but especially Q4 and  next year."

Again, as I've just announced, a significant positive performance on employee unit cost across the group. So, it's  the British Airways, it's Iberia, it is especially Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus because of two positives that they are  bringing. On one side, their own non-fuel employee unit cost reductions, but also averaging down the mix of the  whole group. The exception is Vueling, and the Vueling deterioration in employee costs has to do basically with  disruption and with the additional buffering in terms of resources that the company had to undertake to deal with  this disruption impact."

So, that's going to be entering into a  probably more stable model, switching into a pay-as-you-go, which is based on accruals, and switching out of a  time-and-materials model, which is basically upon cash. But the switch between one model to the other will be  creating a little bit of volatility on that cost line.

Very good news because the four quarters that we have ahead of us will be showing  significant cost reductions, if the international fuel prices stay at this type of level, I think today it was \u2013 yesterday,  it was [ph] $3.45 (19:47) or so."

As many of you know, and as you heard yesterday, as a result of the presentation of the  results for RENOVABLES, in recent years there has been a very different development for the  various renewable technologies in Spain. In 2009, installed wind power in Spain was 90% of the  objective set for 2010, about 20,000 megawatts. While in the case of photovoltaic power, installed  power was more than 3,400 megawatts.

However, in the case of  photovoltaic energy, our country which has high load factors, much higher than in Germany, for  example, has a tariff of \u20ac466 per megawatt hour for around 3,500 megawatts, according to Decree  661, much higher than countries in our area.

Thanks to this, the prices of  electricity in the pool in recent years have been 10% lower than the European average, and I want to repeat this  and reiterate it.

And this means that in Spain the cost per megawatt-hour is the highest in Europe according to  the European energy regulators.\" This is what has created the tariff deficit problem in Spain, an inherited problem  and the current government has already taken major steps to correct it. In 2012, \u20ac3.3 billion was securitized in the  tariff deficit. \u20ac7 billion are still pending for which there is a transfer commitment and we are requesting the  ministry to speed up the securitization. In February, the government approved Royal Decree 1/2012 to  provisionally suspend the procedures for the previous signing of the remuneration and the economic incentives  for the new renewable and cogeneration facilities.

In Royal Decree 13/2012,  unrelated to the generation deficit, that is the distribution activity, and there's no economic model to justify it.  And the methodology to calculate the remuneration for the distribution activity was guaranteed under Royal  Decree 222/2008, which established a general framework for the period 2009, 2012. This certain measure  modifies remuneration conditions that had already been established until December 31, 2012. And this has caused  alarm on the financial markets, and this does not help the value of the companies in the sector, neither do they  help the rating of the Kingdom of Spain. However, I am convinced that this measure, which was taken urgently,  will be completed with others that will help tackle the current structural deficit problem and restore confidence in  our energy model. Measures such as stopping the construction of the most \u2013 costly renewable facilities including  the pre-assigned facilities whose remuneration has grown exponentially in recent years; increasing the cost of the  system; remunerating with non-discriminatory criteria for all the Regulated activities to reduce the current  disparity; and take measures to provide incentives to energy efficiency and which have disappeared, the so-called  progressive tariffs to further liberalize the market; reducing the use of regulated, integrated tariffs; eliminating  items from the tariff that should not be paid for only by the consumer; sharing Renewable cost with Other sectors,  as they have already done in Italy; and while the problem persists to fund future deficits between all the power  agents. In our opinion, the start-up of these measures will bring about predictable and reasonable tariffs."

And in this sense, we need to  continue with the reform of the electric power market to establish a sufficient remuneration framework, both for  our nuclear and combined gas plants, and renewable plants as of 2014. In the case of renewable plants, they have  a transient period between 2013 and 2017, and the remuneration framework called Renewables Obligation  Banding Review has been made public today with a sufficient remuneration adapted to the degree of technological  maturity, as we have defended over the last few months."

As we can see and as the Chairman said, in spite of the difficult  economic conditions that we are going through in Europe, the group continues to grow in its operating lines and  cash flow. Elektro contributed to the results in the first half of 2012. Last year, it contributed since the month of  May and the exchange rate is also favorable since 53% of the EBITDA in these first six months is outside the  Eurozone, which is an important characteristic in this group. Therefore, we've been favored by the revaluation of  the dollar and the pound although we are partially affected by the devaluation of the real. And as the Chairman  said, there are non-recurrent items that have an impact on net profit and the details of which I'll give later on.  Sales increased 9.3% to \u20ac16.992 billion and purchasing 14% to \u20ac10.595 billion. The gross margin grew 3.2% to  \u20ac6.309 billion, including a positive impact of \u20ac112 million due to the exchange rate. Excluding this effect, the  businesses contributed a further \u20ac83 million. The main items responsible for this growth are Renewable and  regulated businesses and especially the International business. Our growth is 9.1% in the UK, 9.7% in the United  States and 41% in Brazil, with the greater contribution of Elektro. Renewables grew 9.1% in gross margin. This  offsets the weak performance of the business in Spain, showing reductions in the gross margin, both in the  liberalised business, 11.8%, and the regulated business, 8.3%, because of the lower output and regulatory impact.  The 2.3% increase because of the increase in emission rights assigned has fallen by 46% because of the lower  price. The net operating cost grew 5.7%. The consolidation of Elektro continues to have an unfavorable impact  since it's being consolidated since May 2011. The exchange rate has increased the net operating cost by \u20ac32  million."

Operating capacity now stands at 13,560 megawatts and installed capacity has reached 14,171  megawatts.  Operating expenses have improved with a drop of 0.9%, because we've had less non-recurrent expenses. And  efficiency improvements also show that the GON megawatt ratio has improved to 4%. The EBIT of the group has  dropped 3.3%, which has a worse evolution than EBITDA because of an increase of 142% in provisions,  fundamentally linked to the integration of Elektro and some non-recurrent provisions basically in Brazil, and  other measures that have to do with promotion of the pipeline as the President pointed out, which affects the  United States and which reached \u20ac44 million."

And this has been in part compensated by the  extended life cycle of the wind farms. And we can also see that there has been a negative impact produced by the  rate of exchange in terms of provisions and amortizations. The net financial results have grown 17%. And this17%  increase is due to two factors; firstly, because there's a lower market value of the hedging factors for rate to  exchange, because last year the dollar and the pound were devalued vis-\u00e0-vis the euro, whereas this year it has  been just the opposite, and this lower market value is something you can see in the financial costs; and secondly,  because there's been \u2013 there have been more financial expenses because of the greater average of debt relative to  the first semester of the previous fiscal year."

And to be more specific, it claims that this is much lower than in the case of  renewable energies, and that is the reason why the remuneration for this asset is being reduced by 100 basis  points, which entails a drop in remuneration of over 13%."

First, I would like to underline the most important aspects of the accounts  and operating trends and I will finish with an analysis of the financial situation, the gross margin has grown 3.3%  and now stands at \u20ac12 billion, although the exchange rate has subtracted nearly \u20ac144 million with growth in the  compensate the weak behavior of the liberalized business in the UK. And without the impact of the rate of  exchange, the gross margin would have grown 4.5%. The consolidation of Elektro that provides \u20ac436 million  compensates the loss of the assets sold in the United States, Guatemala and other assets that have also been sold  that subtract nearly \u20ac300 million. The basic margin has gone up 3.2% in line with the gross margin and now  stands at \u20ac12,275 million and the value of the emission rights allocated in 2011 is only \u20ac1 million higher than  those allocated in 2010. Net operating expenses have grown 1.7% below the growth of the gross margin. And the  lower expenses arising from the sale of the difference businesses, \u20ac103 million, have made it possible to  compensate the greater costs of those associated to Elektro, \u20ac123 million and there has been increase in expenses  in renewables as a consequence of the increase in capacity. And this fiscal year includes \u20ac443 million of non- recurrent impacts because of the hurricanes."

When it started in the year 2000 I think it was because of  volatility in electricity output in Spain, which was very much affected by the price of fuels and the hydroelectric  resources led to volatility in generation costs. And the generator wanted to flattened those costs by saying I'll drop  them when the actual cost is low and I'll increase them in the opposite situation so I won't pass on this volatility to  the consumer. This initially was a good idea but as of 2005, as we can see on the chart, it became a structural  issue. And instead of flattening the volatility in generation costs, it hid the actual environmental cost that the  sector was incurring and it has become a structural deficit that amounts to around \u20ac5 billion."

Of the 15,000 installed megawatts in Spain in  hydroelectric plants, only 600 are over 60 years. Therefore, all the rest have part of their assets pending  amortization and the same goes for nuclear power plants. There are \u20ac7 billion to be amortized over an accounting  life of 40 years and there is still 13 years ago.

And they have the  responsibility of managing the implementation of that energy policy.

In other cases, I think it's the case in Germany but I'm not too sure, when  we're putting all the responsibility into the hands of the electricity sector and therefore the electricity sector covers  all the cost, it doesn't make sense for the electricity consumers to have to take on this burden because it goes  against the provisions of the International Energy Agency. And their first objective is to electrify consumption and  to electrify consumption, we have to make electricity consumption competitive compared to other forms of energy  consumption. If all the environmental costs are passed on to electricity and is paid for by the electricity  consumers, then we're doing exactly the opposite of what the International Energy Agency is saying.

So this year's figure is very much driven by the realizations we  saw in FY 2017, FY 2018, so we've seen an increase in deferred awards there. The other non-staff costs at the  bottom have also increased. These include the costs where we've looked into new strategies and they haven't  been necessarily successful. So this includes, if you remember, for the last years we've been investigating an oil  and gas strategy to see if we can create a fund strategy out of oil and gas assets. Having worked with the team  for 18 to 24 months, we concluded actually the pipeline wasn't sufficient for us to foresee a very long-term fund  strategy and long-term income that we could generate for the FMC.

In  general, we saw healthy demand in all segments, with some seasonal weaknesses in major home appliances. We  started seeing some signs of a modest recovery in general drives for simple factory automation driven by China's  initiatives to establish manufacturing hubs in the Western part of the country. We remain very bullish on the  prospect of renewable energies as both the momentum in the U.S. continues and the indications are solidifying  that China will mandate even higher installation targets in its forthcoming five-year plan."

In the midscale segment, price below Holiday Inn and Holiday  Inn Express, we've identified 14 million guests worth $20 billion in annual industry revenues who are currently  underserved by existing brands. These guests are traveling for both business and leisure and they are looking for  consistency, a clean safe environment, and good value. They want the basics done exceptionally well at the right  price and don't want to feel they are paying for things they don't need."

        "text": "Let\u2019s now talk about Southeast Asia where as you know our main business is Singapore.  No  surprise there the market was down as expected by 33% in the first half and we know this is due to  the significant reduction of the CO2, COE quota on the back of lower deregistration over the last 18  months.  This significant quota reduction has made the market extremely price competitive and  that\u2019s understandable because we\u2019ve seen an increase of the COE price by more than 100% in the  first six months of 2010 compared to the COE price at the end of 2009.  As discussed a few months  ago given the highly discounted environment and given our strong scale position and our market  leadership, we\u2019ve put a strategy in place to protect our margin.  We don\u2019t want to lower price for  sheer market share gains because frankly as a market leader we have more to lose than to gain  and we can do that because we\u2019ve got a very strong after-sales business, tremendous car park and  world class operation and that is helping us to offset some of the difficulties in the new car market.   And I have to say that our business has coped well with this changing environment. And as John  said a return on sales of 8.7% on the back of a revenue decline of 37% is frankly better than we  thought.  This has been achieved through careful pricing management on new vehicles, very good  after-sales performance but also cost reduction. We have realigned the marketing expenditures to  reflect the lower market and also we have reduced our head count, as you would expect."

Year-to-date, we have an increase of 9% on net  sales and organic 3%, and that organic growth was mainly during the first two quarters when we didn't have the  effect from the lower level we have now in energy sector during the second half and the marine sector.

Let's say, if we have figures from in normal July or if we had, let's say, the same volume in the  energy sectors last year, we would have been around 12.9% that is the estimates are, but that's not the situation,  we ended up in 11.9% with the EBITA margin.

So, I must say it's an unusual amount of campus with own brands, also very high margins we  acquired last year and they're doing very well."

And we don't  want growth which is not sustainable. We want stable growth over time. And the best, I would say, receipt on that  is when you look at the Indutrade performance in 2009 when a lot of businesses had very difficult times. Indutrade  went from approximately a margin level of 10% \u2013 12% [ph] now (00:47:19) down to 9%. So, a very stable  performance in a difficult market environment.

On the other side, from a risk management perspective, it gives you  control over mitigating the risk of ending up with stranded assets. So it works on both sides.

These can be used for example for base load, where you have the weak grid, but it can also be used as a balancing  power source. For example, you have wind parks. As you know, if you happen to be an electrical engineer, like  myself, you know that there are a few problems with wind power. One is, of course, the very simple fact that you  don't have wind 24/7. That's of course a problem that needs to be balanced. But the other problem is even in a  strong wind, you may get actually frequency variations in the network. Therefore, you need a balancing engine or  balancing generation capacity to make sure you have a stable network. Same argument in solar power, et cetera."

You also see environmental regulation being increasingly important, a benefit  for W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4. We also see basically the global need for power increases. So if you take regions with a weak utility  system or electrical grid, there is a need to generate local power and they will continue to consume power.

The renegotiations of  ground lease contracts in the form of pure negotiation or cash advance will bring in additional savings in line with  what was achieved this year.

The first half result is \u20ac143.5 million versus \u20ac137.7 million last year. So for the  hydraulic division is flat 4.25%. On the other hand for the industrial division, the Water-Jetting division, the sales  for the first quarter was \u20ac137 million versus \u20ac141.5 million, it means minus 3.1%. What I wanted to underline  considering the company is that in the Water-Jetting division Hammelmann that as you remember was a little bit  down in the first quarter because they had less backlog at the beginning of the year. Now it's almost at the same  level as last year. So practically there is still a small difference, but Hammelmann is growing."

I think that speaking with someone of  you many times, I gave you the idea that it was our interest to enter also in this business, because as you can  understand hoses are the elements that connects all the components all in every single component of an  hydraulic system. So there is no application in the work, there is no activity, no hydraulic activity in the work that  can avoid to use hoses. And what is that very important also to understand, hoses is, let me say, is the first  element that usually breaks during the use of the equipment. The big corporation, they all produce hoses, Parker  produces hoses, Eaton produce hoses. So really we targeted this kind of company for a long time because we  consider hoses a very strategic fit into the hydraulic system."

Be careful  this is not bad news. This is not bad news because they still choose Interpump products. And as you know, our  margins from rental can be even higher.

Also a number of the change-outs are being  delayed into the second half of this year and that's because refining margins are very high at the moment, so our  customers are taking the benefit of cheaper feedstocks and deferring a little bit their change-outs of their catalysts,  but we expect that, as I said, to recover in the second half."

Particular strong outperformance in Europe, as you can see, where our sales grew 16%, and that compares to a  3% growth in the underlying market. So, why is that?

The benefit is larger in heavy duty, which will move  on to next. But an interesting point in the middle there, there is some legislation now in Europe that will require  filters on petrol cars, not for a few years, but even so. That's the first time we've seen filters required on petrol cars,  not all petrol cars, but that's a very good trend for us. And a positive outlook for car demand, as I've already  mentioned.

So this year is really around good demand for catalysts. I think  we'll still see NPT. And the Oil and Gas business should continue to perform well, but the licensing side, as I've  already said, will offset that growth on the catalyst side. And we got three reasons here principally why the  licensing income is dropping, and it's really partly to do with the cold, wet and dew projects in China. Those have  been slowed down, but also the petrochemical capacity is pretty much in line with the market demand today."

The current period of volatility has required the OEMs to  rapidly adjust their platform mix, but it's important to note that these recent trends are consistent with our  assumptions on diesel share. And you will have seen that we're also doing well in gasoline. We still expect to gain  around 5 percentage points in gasoline as the adoption of Euro 6c ramps up.

So what we are showing you here today is the results of independent testing carried out for  us by Qinetiq. This shows the performance of eLNO compared with the current materials in the market and the  next generation materials. eLNO's relative performance improves when we look at cycle life and how it performs  over time, a key metric used by our customers. So, not only do we have the material with the highest energy  density today, but eLNO's performance continues for longer and helps enable a lower total cost over the useful  life.

Although it\u2019s  normal to concentrate the majority of these works in the second half of the year, it is also true that  weather conditions in the first part of the year forced us to delay some investments for the months  ahead. And in June, investments were already accelerated to its normal pace. Still about Poland in  what concerns logistics, two distribution centers are under construction and should be open in the  third and fourth quarters of this year. So by the time of our Investors Day we hope to have the  pleasure to ask you on one of these new logistic centers."

The surplus value sort of gains we have made on the CDO portfolio to the tune of almost \u20ac200  million that is offset by \u20ac350 million negative mark-to-market of our own credit risk. This also explains why we  have a huge \u2013 strong capital strengthening because whereas the gain on the CDO strengthens our capital, the  negative mark-to-market of our own credit risk does not eat into capital given that it's always filtered out for  solvency calculations."

But that is indeed also a good number,  and it reflects the underlying quality of the insurance underwritings."

And we are spending a sizable amount on creating new products and  services. And just a few examples of these innovations, which we have been presented to the market in this  year's Innotrans, let's first stay with the rail vehicle sector, which we ran under the slogan of the Innotrans  Systems.People.xConnected, our new brake control for \u2013 which was used to be the brake control for network  systems, the EP2002, we made now only also suitable to regional and mainline trains. That EP2002 is the best- seller product of ours, and faces little \u2013 very little competition in the market. And we improved this product by  including deceleration control systems delivering consistent break distances that is very important for manless  train operation and break disc temperature monitoring, which improves the vehicle availability even in case of a  fall. This is something that frequently happens, especially in fall conditions that the conductor gets the signal that  break disc is overheating in one of the wagons. And this can be now completely localized with EP2002 and the  train conductor can then continue its journey by adjusting the speed appropriately."

Integrated in our existing door system [indiscernible] (00:07:31) stands for  innovation for entrance systems, we presented the pioneering new ceiling system for sliding doors, which  significantly reduces noise, enhancing passenger comfort and raises energy efficiency, again result is lower  operating cost. If I may iterate again from our presentation we have done on the road show, there is two drivers of  this industry, it's either cost down or it's up time of the train.

For our 2019 revenues,  we are not concerned from today's prospectus. Our order book looks good and our strategy to offer more and  more content to our customers to allow them to respond to tightening environmental and safety regulation to  some extent reduces the impact from the cyclicality of the truck market. That said, in terms of profitability, we  have to acknowledge that material cost inflation and cost associated with the still straight supply chain will effect  of our CVS margin as they do all of our competitors."

These counterweights balance the weight of the spreader,  which is the red device that you see there that holds the container. That's called spreader. And the counterweights  weigh as much as the spreader, which means that they eliminate each other, which means that we are lifting only  the weight of the container, not the weight of the spreader. And this eliminates about 25% of the load in every lift  and saves about 8% in the fuel cost, 8% saving in the fuel cost which is a significant operational saving to the  customer on top of the already attractive price for the product."

This changes the picture quite fundamentally because now this makes the benefits of  automation which, obviously, are operational cost savings and productivity in general and an increase in  predictability of the container moves and the safety of the container moves. Now all these benefits of automation  will become available to existing container yard operators as well. And we believe that many container yards will,  once the time comes for them to replace their RTGs on the container yard, when they come to the end of their  lifetime, and there's a lot of such RTGs out there, when they decide to replace them, they will consider  automation. So, this is the first in the world that Konecranes now introduced, the first time RTG automation  becomes a viable alternative."

And  we, as Kemira, we really are very well positioned in both strength and sizing chemicals which are the ones growing  the fastest."
