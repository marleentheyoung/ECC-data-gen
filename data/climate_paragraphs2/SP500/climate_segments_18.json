CNA has posted consistent underwriting improvement and maintains a  very strong capital position.

The Midstream  weakness is largely gathering and processing in the Eagle Ford and on a year -over-year basis, gathering in the  Haynesville.

        "But what this really means is that reliable flexible natural gas facilities are absolutely necessary to back up wind  and solar.",
        "So to sum up, the idea that we could move directly from coal to renewables without increasing natural  gas usage for electronic generation is an unrealistic pipe dream, with the substance in the pipe being legal only in  Colorado and Washington State.",
        "Now added to the demand picture is the retirement of more coal plants due to environmental regulations and of  nuclear-fueled instruments due to age and operational issues.",
        "And you put all that together and you have a very  bullish growth outlook for natural gas and electric generation.",

        "Additionally, LNG imports to Mexico are on the decline and are  expected to be completely phased out by 2023.",
        "All of these factors support projections that by 2025 natural gas  exports to Mexico are expected to increase from the already elevated levels of 2015 by almost 3 Bcf a day.",

        "Now in addition to being affordable and abundant, I want to stress again some facts about the environmental  friendliness of natural gas.",
        "It emits about half the carbon dioxide emitted by coal and over 30% less than fuel oil  according to the EIA.",
        "In fact natural gas has been essential to national and regional efforts to reduce carbon  emissions.",
        "The White House's Council of Economic Advisers reported earlier this year, and I quote, \"natural gas is playing a  central role in the transition to a clean energy future.\"",
        "Report goes on to note that since 2007, energy-related CO2  emissions in the U.S. have fallen 10%, and a significant factor contributing to the reduction was fuel switching  from coal to natural gas for electric generation.",
        "On a regional basis, ISO New England has stated that as a result of New England's transition from coal and oil to  natural gas from 2001 to 2013, regional emissions of CO2 fell by 23%.",
        "Regional emissions of NOx fell by 66% and  regional emissions of SOx fell by 91%.",
        "But they demonstrate to us that  natural gas usage in this country is and will be robust and growing for an extended period of years.",
        "And for Kinder  Morgan which transports about a third of all the natural gas consumed, this paints a very positive business picture  for years to come.",
        "And we think that in today's broader energy  sector, that's an enviable position to be in.",
        "The largest piece of which is further  reductions in our expansion capital expenditures in our CO2 business, as a result of moving some of our EOR and  S&T investments outside the timeframe of the backlog.",
        "So for the segments, in the third quarter, we produced $1.839 billion of segment earnings before DD&A which  essentially flat to 2014 and that's a result of the decline in our CO2 segment year-over-year not being fully offset  by the year-over-year improvement in our Products and Terminals business segments.",
        "For gas, gas was essentially flat year-on-year.",
        "Now those last three items were all anticipated in our budgeting process and we are still on track in gas to slightly  exceed the 2015 plan.",
        "We had higher transport volumes, up 5% across the segment as we saw a 15% increase in  power-driven natural gas demand year-over-year and 18% year-to-date as Rich mentioned.",
        "Sales and gathered volumes were essentially flat year-over-year, crude and condensate gathered volumes in the  gas group were up 7% as a result of the addition of the Hiland gathering assets.",
        "We continue to see strong demand  for long-term firm natural gas transportation capacity.",
        "We went out with a customized offering for the electric load  in New England, a much-needed load, much-needed for gas.",
        "And we had a few favorable rulings and  recommendations in the state regulatory processes, including approving our existing LDC contracts and also  creating a good opportunity to secure the electric load that we need to make this project very attractive  economically.",

        "As a preferred supplier of solar energy systems to Sunrun for its home solar installation business, Enphase will  provide its microinverters to Sunrun's direct installation services business for the first time.",
        "Sunrun recognizes  that Enphase offers a smart, differentiated, and financially compelling approach to clean energy generation that  delivers strong economics, excellent system performance over the life of the project.",
        "We look forward to working  together with Sunrun, not only as a preferred supplier but as a partner in delivering intelligent energy solutions.",
        "During the second quarter, we signed an agreement with REPOWER by Solar Universe that establishes Enphase  as the primary solar energy system supplier for REPOWER's unique integrated solar power and smart home  energy system.",
        "During the  second quarter, Enphase and My Generation Energy completed and commissioned a 900-kilowatt commercial  project featuring our C250 microinverter system.",
        "In addition, we're seeing increasing global interest for our energy management system which consists of our  microinverter, AC battery, and load control, all managed by our Cloud-based application, Enlighten.",
        "I recently  visited with current and potential customers in the UK, Europe, and Australia, and came away very impressed  with the strong interest in our energy management system to address regulatory requirements, increase the  economic benefits of a solar system, and enable more energy independence.",
        "Interest in our AC battery solution is especially robust.",
        "It's important to note that the anticipated growth of energy storage will continue to increase the value of an energy  management system.",
        "A home, building, or grid employing a system comprised of solar generation, energy storage,  and load management will require an energy management system to create a total solution.",
        "With hundreds of  thousands of customers already using Enlighten, the path toward total energy management for Enphase  customers has already been paved.",
        "We'll start testing and begin certification activities of our AC battery storage  solution later this year as we prepare for our market launch in early 2016.",
        "We have many large, medium, and small customers in the residential and commercial solar markets  worldwide.",
        "We have been able to keep operating expenses at the same level for three quarters in a row at approximately $30  million while continuing to make great progress on many of our R&D projects which include the development of  our AC battery storage technology and energy management system, the fifth-generation microinverter system,  further product cost reductions, and other new and innovative next-generation technology building blocks.",
        "Our unique  value proposition, as well as the superior quality and reliability of our energy system resonates with customers  globally.",
        "The combination of continued solid growth, aggressive cost reduction, ever-increasing performance and  reliability, and the delivery of a complete energy management solution is proving to be very powerful and will  continue to drive further growth with new and existing partners worldwide."

The  Mississippian Lime has been reasonably de-risked by development on and surrounding the property. Third, while  we remain bullish on natural gas over the longer term, these properties should help to diversify HighMount's  reserves, which consist almost entirely of natural gas and liquids.

Average C&I loans were up $1.1 billion or 10.6% annualized. We had strong growth  in corporate lending, mortgage warehouse lending and government finance. I will tell you that C&I lending is  currently mostly in larger participations and it's very competitive, so the spreads are very tight.

Again, this slide excludes Libya because of the unpredictability of those volumes.  As shown on slide six, the second quarter was a good operating quarter for the E&P segment with higher sales  volumes compared to the first quarter.

Let me recap the reason for this non-cash retroactive reinsurance charge. In 2010,  CNA and National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, completed a transaction whereby CNA ceded  to National Indemnity substantially all of its legacy, asbestos, and environmental pollution liabilities subject to an  aggregate limit of $4 billion.

        "And our environmental and process safety incident rates  have declined by approximately two-thirds.",
        "The U.S. ethylene operating  rate remains near our nameplate capacity for the third consecutive year when normalized for the La Porte  turnaround and expansion.",
        "Our European ethylene operating rate of 95% was 12 percentage points higher than  the industry average.",
        "Our propylene oxide and refinery rates also improved year -over-year.",
        "In 2014, approximately 90% of our U.S. ethylene production was sourced from NGLs, and approximately 53% of  our European ethylene production came from advantaged feeds.",
        "The first major ethylene expansion in our growth program was completed at La Porte during last summer.",
        "This  project brought online an additional 800 million pounds of annual ethylene capacity.",

        "We also announced that we're in the process of developing plans for our new  propylene oxide plant.",
        "Overall, we will increase our U.S. ethylene capacity  by 25% and grow global propylene oxide capacity by approximately 35%.",
        "I want to focus your attention on our ethylene production.",
        "Our U.S. data represents production after operation of our flex unit which converts ethylene into propylene.",

        "The charts on the left highlight the  strength of the U.S. ethylene chain and our performance \u2013 and our outperformance in Europe as we increased  feedstock, flexibility and operating rates during 2013 and 2014.",
        "Crude oil was approximately $85 and natural gas was  at $4 per MMBtu.",
        "In the graph, you'll see that at  the end of each of the subsequent years, crude oil remained higher than the $85 price in 2010.",
        "During 2015, major projects include turnarounds at refinery, two propylene oxide facilities and  the Channelview methanol.",
        "Majority of the growth spending will be divided between the Channelview and Corpus Christi ethylene expansions.",
        "The decline in pricing of approximately $0.06 per  pound was offset by a lower cost of ethylene production.",
        "The differential between  ethylene and propylene prices allowed us to profitably operate our flex unit through the quarter.",
        "We also completed the La Porte ethylene  expansion and began realizing the financial benefits of that production.",
        "In January, ethylene price \u2013 margins have  come off their record highs as prices in the market have followed crude oil lower.",
        "We continue to see natural gas  prices below $3 per million BTU, and NGL prices have been weak as inventory have reached record-high levels.",
        "This increase is largely the result of lower cost of  ethylene as a result of lower naphtha cost, increased advantaged feedstock processing and higher production.",
        "2014 also benefited from a $52 million environmental settlement that  was recognized during the first quarter, while 2013 benefited from a $25 million insurance settlement.",
        "Oxyfuel results were relatively unchanged and oxyfuel results were lower by approximately $10 million.",
        "The full-year 2014  increase versus 2013 reflects strength and stability in our propylene oxide business and increased contribution  from our expanded methanol business.",
        "The Channelview methanol plant ran at 68% utilization rate during 2014 and was the primary driver of $175  million EBITDA improvement in the acetyls business.",
        "Oxyfuel results decreased by approximately $30 million  versus 2013, volume and product mix were the primary drivers.",
        "Oxyfuel prices have moderated as crude oil and gasoline prices continue to decline.",
        "Methanol prices have also come under some pressure.",
        "During  the first quarter, we'll be conducting scheduled maintenance on the Channelview methanol plant.",
        "We also expect improved operating  rates from the Channelview methanol unit in 2015 following the first quarter of maintenance.",
        "While we anticipate that U.S. ethylene margins will ease from  record 2014 levels consistent with lower oil and gas prices, they remain relatively strong.",
        "In fact, IHS estimates  current ethylene margins remain above $0.25 per pound."

Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $90 million or $0.53  per share, up from $0.32 in the third quarter of 2008. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter  was $13.1%, up 100 basis points from 12.1% a year ago. Margin for the quarter when compared to  2008 was negatively impacted by a number of financial headwinds caused by the economic climate  as well as the impact of the HRH acquisition, somewhat mitigated by favorable year-on-year foreign  currency; altogether totaling 290 basis points of negative impact. The impact of the HRH acquisition  diluted margin by 200 basis points due to the higher amortization, now offset by synergy savings.",

New features include flexible data capture, improved automation and faster data analysis.  We also introduced a range of new LC products during this quarter's HPLC-2014 in New Orleans. Announcements  include a new next generation UHPLC Multisampler which sets a new benchmark in throughput, speed and  carryover. We also introduced an updated two-dimensional LC system for higher resolution applications. And we  are launching a series of new LCMS and GC-MS product at ASMS next month. These solutions are differentiated  by higher performance and lower costs of ownership making them ideally suited for the applications in our core  markets.",
