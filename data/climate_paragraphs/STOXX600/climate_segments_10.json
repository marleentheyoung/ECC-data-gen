So as you can see, it's at the bottom end of our range.  There's one or two mechanical technical things related to the catastrophes that contribute to that position, but it is  at the lower end of our range. So as far as reserve releases going forward are concerned, there may be a slight  reduction in 2018, but our forward-looking guidance as to what you should expect reserve release wise from  Beazley is the same picture that you've seen in the past."

And so, in the next part of the presentation, I'm just  going to look at our underwriting performance and that remains the key to the results that we're announcing today.  So if I start with the highlights from 2017, it was a year dominated by a high incidence of natural disasters. We're  pleased therefore to be able to report an underwriting profit combined ratio of 99% that compares to prior of 89%  and our average combined ratio, which is 90%. So in achieving this positive outcome, I think there are two things  to point out. One is our balanced business model, specialty lines, which is 50% of our business with the exception  of one or two notifications in our environmental team with those exceptions specialty lines is largely unaffected by  these catastrophe events."

And one area of our business in particular benefited from that  active cycle management was our reinsurance division which despite the fact, it was one-off if not, the most costly  year on record for natural disasters achieved a breakeven outcome."

In total  those are expected to cost the industry $100 billion as well as the California brushfires. And we continue to  anticipate that our losses net of reinsurance will fall within a range of $200 million to $300 million as we reported  in November. So no change in our overall loss estimates or generally on the claims side as Martin has just said,  we were pleased that the reserves for prior liabilities continue to develop positively and our consistent approach to  reserving means that we have finished the year with the reserve over actuarial within our target range of 5% to  10%, albeit right on the low boundary of that range despite the effects of catastrophes."

So it's further growth in specialty  lines, driven by three things. We see continued opportunity for growth onshore in the U.S. The combination of a  more focused distribution strategy and the initiative to put more of our product through our office footprint  continues to drive opportunity across the product range and specialty lines. But if I was going to point to two  things, we see particularly strong opportunities in healthcare and environmental."

We should also expect it to have a slightly different reserve release strategy in specialty lines  [indiscernible] (00:21:41) did because it's shorter tail. It also has aggregation risk or catastrophe risk. So its  reserve releases, if there are any, are more [indiscernible] (00:21:51) shorter tail business with those sorts of  exposure. We have plans to grow both of those in 2019. If anything the plans for specialty lines new are slightly  more growth than CyEx new because some of the real engines of U.S. growth are environmental and  miscellaneous medical, for example, they've been growing quite strongly and the bulk of our international  business is within specialty lines."

In the expenses excluding energy procurement included there is the personnel  expense. Personnel expense went up around CHF 10 million. And now you could ask why if you have a cost  cutting exercise to personnel expenses go up, two reasons. One is in the services business, we do increase our  workforce. So we do go down with our workforce in the infrastructure business. But in services business, we are  willing to go up with the workforce since this is a profitable business. So, therefore, personnel expenses did go up  in the first half year compared to the first half of 2012."

This global trend, most important one I spoke about before is  the pressure on the electricity prices. On the other hand, we still have a growing consumption of electricity. I just  read this morning that according to the car show, probably not in Geneva because that is extreme usually. One  believes really much more in electric cars, that will not have a big impact on electricity consumption but it shows  that the transfer from use of oil and gas to electricity for mobility may increase. It's just a sign that electricity will  become more and more important as the energy source. Still electricity price is under pressure probably for the  next few years to come."

And I would like to mention our projects, in the hydropower production, we have received recently a  number of construction permits for small regulated hydropower plants in Switzerland. They are always quite  complex. So it's not at all to be taken for granted that you do receive this compression. And we are still continuing  to invest into these areas. And we have acquired in Italy just very recently five small hydropower plants also  mainly for the regulated market, 10 megawatts."

We have delivered at the end of last year a basic concept to the  nuclear authority to NP, which has already accepted them as good in principle and we have now delivered since  the middle of this year a detailed planning for investments into M\u00fchleberg in order to allow a further operation of  the plan and they have not yet answered or have not yet commented on the detailed plan. But from a technical  point of view, we are not really expecting any major difficulties. Now, this does not really make our life much  easier because now we have to take a fundamental decision whether we want to invest these funds or not. And in  the current situation where the electricity price is depressed where it is likely to stay at least low in the next few  years, this decision is not an easy one to take and this has not been taken yet but it will be taken in the course of  this year."

BKW has an investment case. Summer, we have a  strong and very robust business model with our portfolio approach and what we are doing and our vertically  integrated business model. So, what we can offer is a certain degree of stability in a very fast-changing  environment. This stability comes from the fact that we are quickly developing new services as we are vertically  integrated and we have direct access to a large number of end customers both through the grid but also through  our sales network and that we do have a diversified production portfolio, diversified in technology, diversified in  regulation and also in geography with our investments in Germany and in Italy. We are a market leader in  renewable energy, and we continue to push this investment. We are at the same time of course following also the  development of regulations. There are also some challenges in this area, but we believe that in those countries  we are invested right now, the regulatory risk can still be very well managed among others by investing into  technologies which are at the \u2013 not too far away from the production costs \u2013 in their production costs, not too far  away from the market price.

So, we hope we are looking forward  that having the decision, so that after rotations in the cities of Basel and Zurich, we'll be able to start to build up  City of Berne has already voted in a quite clear positive way for Grimsel. Third part, the rising of the dam, of  course, will take a little longer, but I'm still optimistic that we'll be able to raise this dam in future as well."

This higher production also is reflected in higher energy procurement cost.  Other expenses were stable, although as already mentioned, our cost reduction program did deliver first results,  we on the other hand grow some other businesses and for these reasons, the other expenses are at about the  same level as in the previous year.

However, this is  based on the internal transfer prices and the key international and trading as the trading hub does buy the energy  from Energy Switzerland at prices three years ago.

Then, we will continue to invest in M\u00fchleberg is the figure  that you see here which is something below CHF 100 million, of course does not yet include the major project that  is right now under evaluation for the long-term operation of BKW. As you may remember, we are now going  through the several legal procedures, and then in the course of this year, BKW will then decide on fully  entrepreneurial grounds and whether or not to invest more than CHF 200 million additionally into Milwaukee that  would then be for a long-term operation."

However, one has to remember that in terms of value and  of capital investment it's the distribution grid that is of importance, 85% of the capital is invested in the distribution  gird and remains also with our company. And as I explained in my beginning remarks, the redesign of the energy  system particularly in Switzerland will be very local, very decentralized, and so it affects mostly the distribution  network at its lower level. We see this as a business opportunity both in terms of a reasonably good investment  case, and also in terms of new business models that can be developed in the interface between the Grid and the  customer."

Ours is eight months and if we include the positive working capital that our business  model requires, it's still a very attractive 15-month. Just to put that into context, at the time of the IPO, since then  we've opened, I don't know 150 stores or something, that number was 14 months, it's now 15 months. Part of that  is a rounding error. But actually, the other part of it, I'm happy to share, is that, within the cost of fitting out our new  stores, it's just inched up a fraction deliberately because of two or three things that we wanted to do at a higher  level. For example, we now use LED lighting rather than old fashioned fluorescent tubes, that has a higher upfront  CapEx cost, but of course, I'm sure you're aware, over a five year, ten year period, it reduces your energy bill.  Similarly, point of sale signage.

For the first time, we launched a model at the same time in all markets. We are delighted, of course, with the  media response. So far, the new 3 Series has come out first in all comparative tests against competitors worldwide.  Our 3 Series has always been an EfficientDynamics pioneer. The BMW 320d EfficientDynamics Edition is the new  CO2 champion in its class. 163 horsepower, fuel consumption at 4.1 liters per 100 kilometers and 109 grams of  CO2 per kilometer. EfficientDynamics, ladies and gentlemen, is a success story. EfficientDynamics makes our cars  even more attractive and keeps their value at a high level for a long time. We want to maintain and strengthen our  lead in the future."

From 1995 to 2008, there was an agreement among EU car  companies to reduce average CO2 emissions by 25% across the fleet. We were the only car company in ACA that  fulfilled our promise. What's more, we went beyond this goal, achieving a 27% reduction. At present, the BMW  Group fleet in Europe emits an average of 148 grams of CO2 per kilometer. At the same time, we increased  performance as the average of 173 horsepower shows.  Looking ahead at 2015, the EU has set a new CO2 target of 130 grams per kilometer for all European cars. We are  totally confident that we will meet the target set for the BMW Group. Our new highly-efficient engines and new  models such as the new BMW 3 Series will enable us to achieve these goals. As well, the BMW ActiveHybrid  models are another step in this direction. Our intelligent, full hybrid drive concept will be available in the new  BMW 3 Series, the new BMW 5 Series as well as the updated BMW 7 Series."

We recently presented our  new 360-degree collision prevention system in a BMW i3 at CES in Las Vegas. The system can reliably identify  obstacles and apply the brake in order to prevent accidents. Even today, we offer many driver assistance systems,  such as traffic jam assistant and active speed control. Our future models will be able to drive themselves in certain  situations, such as in parking garages. If desired, the car finds its own parking spot without the driver being  involved. We have shown this system with the BMW i3. And upon returning to the garage, drivers can summon  their car using a Smartwatch."

The first, and that's  obviously the most important, is that Water is really \u2013 has really stepped up versus last year in terms of  underlying base performance for two reasons. Number one, because the improvement in Western Europe have  confirmed, and they have confirmed in the second quarter as well.

Another chart you've seen in July hasn't changed either is that  WhiteWave will help us strengthen. At that time, I said fast forward the writing of our transformation. This is still  absolutely the case, by on the left side, bringing the entire sustainability and sustained growth of both dairy and  dairy alternative protein-based fermented products. This is where Danone has a fundamental expertise and where  WhiteWave has a fundamental expertise. And this will, on the right side of this chart, double the size of our  business in the U.S. We'll be entering the top 15 league of the largest companies in the food and beverage space,  but by far, the fastest growing in the environment that I just described.

This increased, as I said, this accident increased by \u20ac19 billion and  now stands at a high \u20ac71 billion.

If I look at  the evolution of the quarter, this means that the Basel 3 fully-loaded ratio improved by again, for lack of a better  word, a mighty 60 basis points with half of the benefits accruing from the combination of the net income, which  we showed you are solid and the RWA reduction stemming from our Adaptation Plan. However, the other half of  the benefit came from the revaluation in the available for sale portfolio. So, it's on the upside. This clearly  illustrates the volatility introduced by Basel 3, so those who would have forgotten about it, this is what the  removal of the prudential filters do to you and it basically confirms in our mind that it was wise for us to reduce  our sovereign debt portfolio."

Operating profit increased by 9% to \u00a3244 million, with operating margin up 30 basis points at  constant exchange rates due to recent higher margin acquisitions.

Plastic straws became a much talked about issue in the UK in early 2018. Almost overnight, customers  wanted to switch from plastic to paper straws. We already had paper straws in our product range, and we were,  therefore, able to adapt quickly to this changing demand. As a result, last year in the UK, the volume of plastic  straws we sold fell significantly, but was more than made up in value terms by increased sales of paper straws,  resulting in a 25% increase in the total sales value of straws. This demonstrates our sourcing capabilities and  expertise in sustainable products, as well as the agility of our supply chain."

Compared to [ph] dig (15:36) Aitik, it's a  relatively small resource, but it's high grade and it fits well into the profile and production going forward.

As many of you know, I spent my entire professional career at BP. I love the company and  everything it stands for. I thought long and hard about what is the right course of action. It is clear  that this tragedy will leave BP a changed company and that to move forward, particularly in the  United States, it should do so under new leadership. It is for that reason I have agreed with the  Board to stand down as CEO. In the unstinting way in which BP has met its obligations, I believe  the company has demonstrated what corporate social responsibility really means. That  responsibility applies to individuals as well as companies. I plan to work with Bob over the coming  months to affect a smooth transition and support him in every way possible. I know that with Bob as  my successor, I\u2019ll leave the leadership of BP in safe and able hands. My final thoughts are with the  families and friends of those who died on the 20th of April. We can and will compensate those  financially affected by the spill, and in the long run, we can restore the environmental impact on the  Gulf Coast. But nothing can bring back the 11 people who lost their lives. We must never forget  them and it is important that everyone remembers them on days like today."

This project is one of  the largest and most complex refinery projects ever undertaken in BP, and when commissioned in 2013 will  conclude over five years of design and construction. The project will significantly increase the capability of the  Whiting refinery to process heavy crude. It will also give a unique flexibility of access to three major geographic  crude sources: the Gulf of Mexico, the Midcontinent U.S., and Canada. It will provide industry-leading flexibility  to respond to market dislocations at true world-scale levels."

Trading conditions have  been particularly volatile, resulting in lower oil prices and lower contribution from U.S. gas. The sharp decline in  oil prices has also led to some unusually large duty lag and forex effects in TNK-BP and adverse pricing of  feedstock into our U.S. refineries. Added to this is the impact of the large planned maintenance program we have  undertaken during the quarter in the Gulf of Mexico, which is part of enhancing safety and reliability for the  future.

BP's second quarter underlying replacement cost profit  after interest and tax was $3.7 billion, down 35% on the same period a year ago, and 23% lower than the first  quarter of 2012. Group underlying replacement cost profit for the quarter benefited by $460 million from the  consolidation adjustment for an unrealized profit and inventory, reversing the loss reported in the first quarter.  Our second quarter headline replacement cost profit includes a pre-tax nonoperating charge of $5 billion, which  includes impairments of $4.8 billion, of which $2.7 billion were in the downstream, relating to the global refining  portfolio predominantly in the United States, and $2.1 billion in the upstream relating to U.S. shale gas assets and  the decision to suspend the Liberty project in Alaska."

Organic capital expenditure  in the first half of 2012 was $10.6 billion, and we expect the full year to be around $22 billion, in line with the  guidance we gave you in February. In February, we told you the full-year depreciation, depletion, and  amortization for 2012 would be around $1 billion higher than in 2011. We now expect it to be around $1.4 billion  higher than 2011, with the revision mainly due to higher decommissioning costs. We continue to expect full-year  underlying production in 2012 to be broadly flat with 2011, excluding TNK-BP. Reported production for the full  year is expected to be lower than 2011 due to the impact of divestments, which we continue to estimate at around  120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The actual outcomes will depend on the exact timing of divestments and  project startups, OPEC quotas, and the impact of the oil price on production-sharing agreements. As I previously  mentioned, guidance for the full-year effective tax rate remains in the range of 34% to 36%.

Another is negotiating a rate reduction of over 30% for drilling our latest development well on the  Mungo asset in the U.K. North Sea, and around 10% rate reduction from major well service suppliers globally,  including a 20% weight reduction on tubulars."

This underlying growth reflects new major projects volumes in the North Sea and Angola, as  well as the absence of seasonal weather-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. Compared to the second quarter,  the result reflects higher liquids realizations and the benefit of the TAPS cost pooling, partly offset by higher  noncash costs, lower gas realizations, and lower production. On the back of stronger -than-expected third quarter  production, benefiting from the absence of seasonal adverse weather in the Gulf of Mexico, we now expect fourth  quarter reported production to be broadly flat with the third quarter and costs to be higher with the absence of the  TAPS pooling settlement benefit."

Relative to a year ago, the result was impacted by lower production volumes and a loss from  our gas trading and marketing operations but benefited from higher prices and lower depreciation.  Production was 3.67 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, 9% lower than a year ago and 6%  lower after adjusting for the effects of acquisitions and divestments of around 85,000 barrels per  day, plus 40,000 barrels per day of entitlement effects on our production sharing agreements. This  reduction reflects a higher level of turnaround activity than in the fourth quarter of 2009, particularly  in the North Sea and Angola, and the continued impact of the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium. It  also reflects the absence of the 40,000 barrels per day benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 related  to the makeup of a prior period underlift, which we talked about a year ago.

This is the usual breakdown of profits  and operating capital employed between the Fuels Value Chains and the international businesses,  including history back to 2007. In the Fuel Value Chains overall, profit has improved by $0.5 billion.  In fuels marketing and supply, earnings were down $1.4 billion, driven in large part by very poor oil  trading performance and also the marketing impact in the U.S. in the aftermath of the Gulf of  Mexico oil spill incident. Refining posted a profit for the first time since 2007 and improved by $1.9  billion year on year. This was mainly driven by improvements in our U.S. operations while  maintaining good performance elsewhere. Refining Solomon availability was 95% in 2010, the best  level since 2004. Throughputs were up 140,000 barrels a day, and utilization rates globally were  91%, up over 6 percentage points versus \u201809 and significantly above industry averages."

Starting at the bottom with  growing margin share, we delivered considerable growth in the international businesses, offset by  oil trading, so we actually went backwards on this measure in 2010. We made significant progress  in both repositioning cost efficiency and from portfolio quality and integration in the Fuel Value  Chains through better operations, higher utilization, and better optimization of the integrated  margin. We\u2019re ahead of our plans on both these dimensions.

This slide shows profit and return on capital employed, both pre-tax, for the  major constituent parts of R&M. For each asset class, both 2008 and 2010 are shown. Capital  employed is reflected in the size of the bubble. The chart is not adjusted for environment, and  refining margins fell from an RMM of nearly $16 a barrel in 2008 to about $10 a barrel in 2010. You  can clearly see the quality of the international business, in orange, with absolute profit increasing by  about $1 billion over the last two years and pre-tax return on operating capital in the 19% to 33%  range. These businesses are also capable of material growth. Indicated in yellow, the earnings in  the Eastern Hemisphere Fuel Value Chains have fallen back by $1.3 billion due to lower oil trading  contribution and lower refining margins, materially offset by underlying improvements, delivering  profit in 2010 of nearly $2 billion and returns of over 10%.

The  backdrop to our strategic choices is one of flat to declining demand for fuel in the U.S. and Europe,  with decline of fossil fuel demand accelerated by the penetration of biofuel. It\u2019s also in the context of  significant growth for fuel lubricants and petrochemicals in the emerging economies. For the last 18  months, we\u2019ve been considering the future performance potential of the whole portfolio in both  relative and absolute terms. In addition to meeting strategic hurdles, such as configuration and  market location, integration, and growth potential, we also expect our Fuel Value Chain businesses  to reach returns above cost of capital at the bottom of cycle conditions and to make a material  contribution to BP over time. Although we\u2019ve concrete mans to improve further all parts of the U.S.  Fuel Value Chain portfolio, parts of it fail the strategic hurdles, and current performance does not  meet these financial goals. This is the backdrop to the decisions we\u2019ve announced this morning."

In the south, BP has a Fuel Value Chain with Carson refinery at  its core and high marketing shares in Southern California and related marketing in Nevada and  Arizona. However, the refinery has limited feedstock flexibility, is gasoline biased, and will require  investment in logistics and/or configuration to improve this. While this business has material  potential for improvement, which we are pursuing, it will also require investment to take it to a new  level of capability in a highly competitive market. Given our plans elsewhere in the U.S., we\u2019ve  therefore decided to exit the southern Fuels Value Chain and intend to complete this transaction  also by the end of 2012, again subject to relevant approvals.

The refinery is better located and  more feedstock flexible, being both pipeline connected to Canada and also closer to ANS supplies.  The financial performance and integrated margin are better than the south and will meet our  criteria. As a result, we intend to retain the northern part of the West Coast as part of a U.S. Fuel  Value Chain strategy which focuses on feedstock advantaged, product flexible, highly upgraded,  well-located refineries integrated into advantaged logistics and marketing.

This shows the Nelson complexity and  average scale of BP\u2019s global refining portfolio post-2013 relative to the current position. Post- divestment of the two positions in the U.S. and the transformation of Whiting, our average scale  and complexity are both slightly lower than today but still in the pack with our leading competitors.  This is before any further upgrading of Rotterdam. Perhaps the biggest implications of the  announced moves will be simply that BP will be the smallest refiner of the traditional supermajors at  just under 2 million barrels a day of capacity. And the proportion of BP\u2019s capacity in the U.S. market  will fall from 50% of the portfolio today to just over one-third. That concludes my remarks on the  Fuels Value Chains."

Returning to the earlier format but now looking at post-2012 performance for a range of refining  margins similar to an RMM of $8 to $12 a barrel, you can see that the Fuel Value Chains in both  the U.S. and the Eastern Hemisphere are expected to be of a similar quality, delivering 10% to 20%  pre-tax return on operating capital, but with the U.S. portfolio smaller than that of the Eastern  Hemisphere. The international businesses are expected to continue to grow and to deliver pre-tax  returns in the 20% to 35% range through the cycle. Taken together, this means that from 2013, all  asset classes should be delivering absolute returns which are attractive while also being material.  That deals with returns and materiality."

Our experience has been built across the key capability areas of prevention and drilling safety, well capping and  containment, relief wells, spill response and crisis management. This has been a significant journey of learning for  BP, and we've been asked to share our experiences with many others in the industry and among regulators and  governments worldwide.

The background to this, as you know, is that BP invested significantly in certain areas of functional  capability following the Deepwater Horizon incident, which was also a period of strong inflation. At the same time,  we started divesting non-core assets. This triggered a need to streamline our supporting functions and structures,  so they are the right size to support our new portfolio without sacrificing safety and risk management in any way."

The  strong progress we have made to-date in structurally rebalancing our financial frame is allowing us to maintain our  dividend and underpins our confidence in pursuing the inorganic transactions already noted by Bob. This is  consistent with our aim to retain the dividend at a level we believe is supported by the long-term cash generating  potential of our businesses while balancing investment to ensure we can grow free cash flow over the longer  term."

On supply, U.S. tight oil is expected to  continue to grow strongly, especially in the second half of the year as new pipeline infrastructure is introduced. On  demand, we expect growth to remain above average, supported by continuing gains in China and India.

Year-to-date, prices have returned to recent  average levels of around $3 due to milder weather. Relatively low levels of storage mean that prices are likely to  remain sensitive to weather conditions over the next few months. So, as investors and the wider society are faced  with the challenges of near-term price volatility, so too are we focusing our collective attention on the dual  challenge facing the global energy system. That's meeting society's demands for more energy, while at the same  time working to reduce carbon emissions to help the world tackle the threat of climate change."

To  begin, let me briefly touch on the key global trends that are shaping our Downstream industry. Driven by rising  prosperity, global demand for fuels, lubricants, and petrochemicals products is expected to continue to grow. The  majority of this growth will come from developing economies. Demand is also projected to significantly grow  across common use retail markets. As the energy transition evolves, products and services will need to be  delivered in new and better ways, creating increased demand and material gross margin pools in the areas of  advanced mobility, bio and low carbon products, as well as the circular economy. Digital transformation will also  continue to rapidly progress."

FTTP delivery will also be  dependent on customer demand, and therefore, Openreach is consulting with CPs, Ofcom and Government.  Under the right conditions, we could reach over 1 million homes a year with FTTP and as many as 10 million by  the middle of the 2020s."

And this is what it means, is the big  green cabinets; you put this in the ground with the big green cabinet set over it. And in the past, we always had to  dig the hole and put in concrete and then wait for it to set. That would add a week, maybe two weeks to the whole  it when it's really cold, because concrete has a problem setting when it's really cold.

Secondly, we are  continually monitoring through the land acquisition process, what is happening in a land market, and we're trying  to assess the sustainability of the land market.

And you can see from the orange  bars and the chart which represent consented land spot market purchases that as the land became unsustainably  expensive we were pulling back from the market. As we went through the downturn, we were lowly committed in  terms of land acquisitions. As we came in to the flat period, that stagnant period within the cycle, we were big on  consented land.

But we've also seen, generally, a relatively constrained group of  buyers, particularly the smaller private housebuilders who, still, are constrained in terms of capital. If you  combine those two features, we have a land market that's acting in a very orderly way. In fact, Knight Frank, in a  recent report, suggested that greenfield residential values in 2014 increased by only 2.3%. And that tells me that  what that is saying is the land market is reacting sensibly to higher house prices but higher build costs, giving a  land value that is not radically different from year-to-year between 2013 and 2014. That's a very orderly position,  certainly compared to what we may have seen in previous upswings."

Only 4% of the owned land bank is over  \u00a3600,000, next to nothing. 42% is under \u00a3300,000, which is a very, very safe place to be, and that's growing. So,  if you just looked at what we bought in 2018, those statistics would enhance that. 91% is on lower risk greenfield  developments. We only really build two-storey standard houses, very limited apartments. And there's hardly  anything over three-storeys. It is as low-risk house builder as you are going to get."

We're driving down  costs in the business through a number of key initiatives. Our new group head of procurement is making excellent  progress in rationalizing group deals. And to give you an example, through standardization of our product and  commitment to volume, we have renegotiated terms of our suppliers for drainage, radiators and boilers and those  alone have generated savings of \u00a3750,000 per year. And our savings are not just focused on materials, we've  also renegotiated our electricity supply contracts for temporary buildings and offices throughout the UK. And this  has generated savings of around \u00a3300,000, and together these two items total \u00a31 million of procurement savings  per annum. The introduction of our standard house type range, the Artisan collection has given us the platform to  improve our buying power and is fundamental to making the group more efficient.

Well,  as you see on this slide 34, our overall assessment is even though Planet stores are outperforming non-converted  stores in terms of sales and in traffic, and that the sentiments are very positive coming from our clients, the results  to-date are still below our expectations."

So this means bringing in more payrolls or bringing  in more deposits in the terms of pensions, credit cards, debit cards, et cetera, et cetera. And this is quite an  interesting phenomenon, which is taking place today or these days in Spain. Anyway, pricing is still impacted by  difficult funding and competitiveness of the environment.

[indiscernible] (19:09) valuation effects amount to \u20ac91 million in the first quarter, and are again a main  driver of reported revenues. \u20ac68 million of those stem from the recovery of a fully-written off hedging counterparty  exposure in public finance.

On a  positive note, we managed to reduce commercial real estate and shipping exposures quarter-on-quarter by \u20ac300  million each, thereby offsetting the increase in public finance. The recovery of the above-mentioned hedging  counterparty exposure caused an increase in both Public Finance EaD and RWAs.

This is one percentage point better than our March guidance. Our operating companies identified  opportunities in a number of areas to further reduce costs. Certain expenses relating to the Costa Concordia  incident were less than we had forecasted and the litigation settlement I previously mentioned also contributed to  this improvement.  On a final note, I wanted to share with you our current rules of thumb about the impact that fuel prices and  currency can have on our results. To start with, a 10% change in the current fuel price excluding the impact of fuel  derivatives represents $0.26 per share for the full year. For the remaining half of 2012 it represents $0.13 per  share."

The second rule of thumb relates to our  current fuel derivatives portfolio where a 10% reduction in the price of Brent for the remaining half of 2012 would  result in an additional $0.04 of realized losses on fuel derivatives that would offset the $0.13 per share favorable  impact from the reduced price of fuel."

Many of our customers try to follow this trend. However, the reality is that whenever an existing synthetic  ingredient is exchanged with a natural one, often the entire formulation of the respective product must be  adapted. You might read silicon-free on a bottle, but in effect, by exchanging one ingredient for another, it is often  necessary to add another synthetic ingredient due to the formulation change in order to achieve the same  performance, the same texture, as well as a comparable feel of the end product."

As you remember, the first half of the year was materially  influenced by pretty unusual UK weather patterns with low temperatures and that resulted in higher than normal  seasonal gas and electricity consumption. And the effect in the UK was an increase in energy used by British Gas  customers and additional demands on our Services business. The impact of higher consumption on profit,  however, was largely offset by the substantial increase in environmental costs associated with the government's  low carbon policies, particularly the ECO program, as well as some higher commodity costs."

However, this was more than offset by a reduction in the retail power book with unit margins  remaining at lower levels during 2018.

As you all know 2010 was a year of rising gas and power prices. Gas prices of course are  still well short of parity with oil, but if you remember they were just 30 pence per therm this time a  year ago, despite the high demand we had at the time due to the cold weather. Whereas today they  are up around 55 pence a therm. And the forward curve would, of course, imply that that will be  sustained through 2011 with very little seasonal variation."

Nevertheless, margins remained healthy  and at 6.7% were actually higher than those for residential energy in the UK."

I understand the widespread concern about energy prices,  and the reasons for the high level of public and political interest. First and foremost, we must serve our customers  competitively and with integrity. We must also work hard to explain ourselves and the investment risks that our  business undertakes in supplying our customers, and in helping to deliver the energy needs of the UK. Our supply  margins reflect the significant commodity price and weather risks that we carry on behalf of our customers.  Transparency on prices and profits is essential if we're to ensure an informed discussion about the UK energy  industry."

As you can see,  the bill has risen from 2009 to 2013 as commodity prices rose, and other elements of the bill such as transport and  distribution costs and the cost of environmental programs also grew. The average bill fell in 2014 as a result of the  re-phasing of the ECO program, which we passed through immediately, and the impact of warmer weather on gas  demand. Our average post-tax profit in 2009 was \u00a354 per customer, equivalent to a 5% margin, but has fallen to  \u00a342 in 2014, a post-tax margin of about 4% on the average dual fuel bill, and representing a profit of about \u00a30.80  per week per customer.

Our performance in the second half of 2017 was weak, particularly in Business  energy supply. This weak performance announced in November, at the time of our trading update, combined with  uncertainty around our future prospects in UK energy supply, significantly amplified by the Prime Minister's  announcement in October that the UK Government would pursue a market-wide price cap of the standard  variable tariff and other default tariffs, taken together, resulted in a significant fall in our share price in 2017,  particularly over the fourth quarter."

In 2015, as part of our  strategic review, we identified three fundamental trends in energy and services; decentralization of the energy  system as a result of the response to climate change; increased choice in power, shifting to the customer; and  advancements in digitalization and technology. These trends have, if anything, become clearer over the last four  years. Centrica's strategy is aligned to them and the changes required in the energy system as society seeks to  address climate change. Energy used per unit GDP in our core markets is falling, and we must provide more than  just commodity energy supply. This is both a challenge and an opportunity. There are also specific regulatory  issues in both North America and in the UK, including price controls with the default tariff cap now in place and  uncertainty over the future of the capacity market. Being only an energy supplier is unlikely to be an attractive  business model moving forward.

Our acquisition of  REstore in 2017 has given us all the software, hardware and expertise to help customers manage their energy  demand to either generate revenue or save costs. This example shows how we can save customers money in  North America, by forecasting peak load using our advanced REstore software and algorithms and then helping  customers identify flexible load, which can be turned down during these peak times. If the customers want us to,  we can also directly control the customer's load within pre-agreed parameters. We would typically take a share of  these savings or revenue."

We now have the positions and capability to lock in value from location gas price spreads and from  optionality to send divertible cargoes to other markets. In total, we've transacted 200 cargoes across more than  20 countries in the last four years. The LNG business represents a material future growth opportunity for Centrica."
