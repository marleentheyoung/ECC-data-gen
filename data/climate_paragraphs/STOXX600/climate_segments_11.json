Most critical parts are electronic and electromechanic components.

Why do we increase it to \u20ac850 million? Though, natural rubber prices are definitely  somewhat below their peak, not too much, but below their peak. Well, this is the unforeseen price increase in  butadienes, somewhat linked as well to the earthquake in Japan. And the butadienes are very important input into  the synthetic rubbers. And this unfortunately is more than compensating the positive effect, the slight price  decrease, which we had seen on the natural rubber side.  On page 16, on the left graph, we have shown this increase in the butadiene cost and we have given some average  prices of butadiene. Average 2009 was $0.75 of $1 per kilogram and we are now at average year-to-date at $2.36.  So this is more than fourfold the price we have only seen two years ago. So the relative increase is much stronger  than we even have seen it at natural rubber. And again, this makes mostly out for our increase in the guidance to  the more than \u20ac850 million.

We see, unfortunately, the  opposite development in synthetic rubber prices in 2012 where we expect an average of $3 per kilogram. And this  stronger increase as well in 2012.

So, clearly, we\u2019re against the backdrop of the \u2013 where the economic growth is fairly  moderate, be it France or Italy in terms of expectations against our backdrop. Possible return of  slight inflation and a long-term trend of more long-term savings seem to us to be positive factors to  our real estate sector and in particular to commercial real estate. I\u2019d say that in France and in Italy  today, there are few new office spaces available, there\u2019s structural demand. So, the changes that  we expect to considerable uses, indeed, want comprehensive real estate solutions. And so this  policy of partnership that we\u2019re implementing for a long time now with our key accounts is coming  fully into its own but also real expectation in terms of environmental performance, and increasingly  we\u2019re talking about green buildings that need strong environmental constraints."

This is natural and organic, that sector of the market is only about 2% now, it's growing at  10% plus a year, it will be 5% in the market in five years and that's a huge market but it's a niche and as Sean  pointed out there's lots of people over the years, what we do is make it more green for the customer. Cold  processable, less energy, low aquatic toxicity. We don't kill things, biodegradability, free from petrochemicals,  another growing niche."

And what maybe surprising to all, there is a lot of water in oil when it  comes out of the ground; 2.5 times at the moment, more water than oil. In 2025, five times more, as extraction  proves more difficult and as wetter and heavier oil is coming out.

That capitalization will cease at the end of the first quarter when  that plant is due to come on stream. Therefore, the interest that we're paying goes back to the P&L. That's the  delta of about \u00a33 million of additional interest to the P&L in 2018."

However, about six weeks into  production at the end of last year, we had a small leak of ethylene oxide which caused us to shut the plant down.  We traced that to a faulty gasket that have been fitted, but what we are doing is checking every other part of the  installation to make sure that, that problem hasn't been replicated anywhere.

How do we make sure that in  an environment of low interest rates, of volatile capital markets, how can we really catch up and compensate for  the negative effects? We have looked at three levers. One is selective growth. We want to accelerate growth on  the commercial P&C. We want to accelerate growth on the Health business, and we want to accelerate on the  capital light Life business."

We have  moved very strongly to de-risk and reduce volumes on our GMxB portfolio for better margins. We believe that this  is the right move in these conditions. For example, for the Accumulator series sold in 2007, we would have needed  7.8% of any initial dollar investment of capital backing, whereas for Accumulator 2011, because of the actions we  have taken on the less risky asset allocation and less rich features, the initial capital has fallen to 0.2%. This also  translates into the reactivity or statutory capital to the movements in the markets. And we can see from the slide  for a 100 basis point drop in interest rates, the impact on capital for accumulate at 7, would've been 12.1% versus  1.6% for today's retirement cornerstone and 0.2% for accumulate to 2011.

The dividend is an important point for us because it's both a number and a message. The number is  \u20ac0.95.

When we look at the headlines, I would like to mention four topics to you.  The first one is it was a year of excellent operational performance. You have seen that the entities have really  performed well. We have reached record earnings levels with AXA we have never seen despite the fact that we  have been hit in Q4 by high natural catastrophes, mainly on the XL side. This was the first quarter of XL that we  consolidated and it was an abnormal quarter of natural catastrophe. The integration of XL into AXA to make a  new joint force is progressing well, I'll come back to it later. And as a result of this, the board of directors has  decided yesterday to propose to the shareholders a strong dividend growth of 6%, very much in line with the trend  on the underlying earnings."

We have a rough ownership at the closure of 80% in the year of  2018, and secondly, as I mentioned, despite the fact that we had high natural catastrophes in the fourth quarter  mainly coming from XL. The underlying earnings per share is up plus 3%, there this is obviously on a basis where  the foreign exchange movements are considered. When you look at the adjusted earnings per share, they move  up by 1% and the dividend is moving from 126% to 134%, which is a 6% increase given a payout ratio at 52%."

How can we bring AXA and XL together, what are the  diversification effects because there is a significant diversification by putting the two together since our main risk  used to be European windstorms and now with a large U.S. exposure, there's a much higher diversification. But  we also aligned the joint program to the AXA approach of the risk appetite, which is done, which is implemented  and as we have shown you last year, on a combined basis, which has led us to reduced maximum exposure."

And \u20ac400 million is very consistent to, again, the graph we showed you in November for a 1-in-10 year  experience, which is exactly what we had in 2018.

I think it's fair to say as well that that revenue growth  we'd expect to more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. There's a number of key reasons for  that."

Bottom line, MIP projects delivered cost-out benefits in  2017 but this was more than offset by headwinds or other cost increases.

We simplified our footprint closing both Greensboro and a small plant in Malaysia. And, third, we had  several sourcing programs delivering favorable purchase price variances.

We'll get  some extra benefit out of Haina labor rates, and that's why you see the green plus sign there.

Our environmental business, continuation, we've talked about the hazardous waste business, that's a  business where we've seen a lot of competition and price pressure. There wasn't much change in that in the first  half. But probably the non-hazardous sector was a little bit better than it had been, driven really by \u2013 and those  are all pretty modest in the overall scheme of things within the group. But, nonetheless, we saw some increased  construction activity in the second quarter and that's an important factor in terms of driving waste volumes for the  business. So, that was a little bit better. On our food and beverage business, again, the growth modest, driven by  good revenue growth in our health food and indulgence food categories."

We are pleased with how things are going there in an Environmental. It's taken a little bit of time, but I think it's  getting there."

So, just moving straight into the revenue line, clearly, within Energy, revenue in a value sense isn't as  important as, because of the movements in the price of oil. We'll more look at volume, volume up 13.3% but up  0.4% organically. Selling prices on average on a constant currency basis down just over 5% primarily due to the  price of oil. Revenue excluding DCC Energy is more relevant up 1.8% on a constant currency basis, really driven  by acquisitions."

I think we've clear kind of demonstration of that strategy in action.  So in the LPG division, we bought the Retail West business. We took it over on the 1st of April just gone. Buying  that business was [indiscernible] (00:23:19) 0.6% share of the highly fragmented U.S. LPG market. It was by a  platform that we could start to consolidate further on. We've been busy building relationships, working those  relationships as we typically do to find acquisition opportunities. So we're very pleased to be announcing Pacific  Coast Energy today. That's a business operating in the northwest of the U.S.; it's in Washington and Oregon. It  has six facilities. It's supplying product into both residential customers and into commercial customers and it is  very synergistic with our existing business. We have three states where we have very strong positions: In Indiana,  in Illinois and in Kansas, and we have a modest or more modest presence in seven other states before we  announced this acquisition. So, part of the strategy within the U.S. is to build out into new markets, into new  regions, and then obviously infill acquisitions in the markets that we're already in or within the states that we're  already in. So it's a \u00a330 million acquisition, so it's material enough in terms of a first-step within building and  consolidating that U.S. market and just to remind people like there's 4,000 players within the market. It's very  fragmented. There's a small number of larger players and there's lots and lots and lots of smaller players, so this  plays very much into DCC's sweet spot of acquiring, integrating, extracting synergies out of energy businesses,  so very pleased with that acquisition."

Also recall, you probably don't need this reminder, that our activities are strongly  impacted by seasonal factors therefore our first half is always very atypical and therefore one should refrain from  extrapolating first half results to the whole of the year and this is particularly true in the activities which force our  employees to deal with weather conditions and particularly in the road sector. Now Christian, our financial  director, will go into the details of that and the impact of it, the tax and social measures, cash. First of all I'd like to  emphasis our revenues, which have held up well in the Contracting sector, organic growth is up 1.2%, which is  added to the 1.3% effect of external growth at the beginning of the year."

When it comes to BTP, civil  engineering, there was a negative effect of the LME law, but that was more than offset by  improvements in the working capital requirements internationally with the recovery of certain debts,  and amounts collected on major construction sites.

We'll be developing Contracting business, especially our energy division, which is a great source of  satisfaction; also our specialized businesses. We're developing international activity as well, particularly in  emerging countries and oil and gas-producing countries. This means we're going to intensify efforts in two areas;  firstly in-house, inside the company, we think there are a lot of ways we could tease out by really tapping into  great synergy between the various entities such as what we did with the SEA high-speed. We only won this  because all of our divisions pulled together, Concessions, Contracting worked hand-in-hand. Also something we're  starting to do very well, that we continue developing for instance in Africa where currently we're really well- established in transport, infrastructure, road and hydroelectric, and it's a constant where we think that we can do  some further cross-selling, gradually establishing other specialties of ours.

Just note also  that the spare part and accessories were down a little between as well. In fact, partly is the same reason as for  Belron. When you have a mild winter, you have \u2013 you sell less parts, such as tires, winter tires, you sell less parts  whole body, [indiscernible] (00:26:08), so less windscreen, and this explains partly the sales variation versus last  year."

Just  to mention in Belgium, we had about five frost days since the beginning of the winter normally at this time of the  year, we should have about 30 frost days. So the beginning of the year in Europe was very bad. It was partly  compensated by better condition in the United States. However, the fall through ion United States is lower than in  Europe for two reasons. Firstly, the average price in the US is lower and also the variable cost base is higher in  the United States. And one of the reasons for that is that, for instance, part of the fitters are paid by job rather than  being paid by days or by month. So there is a bigger variable contribution in United States."

Home's commission ratio improved as a result of profit commission movements, as I mentioned before."

An  improvement, significant improvement of more than 100 bps in the fourth quarter and for the full year, an  improvement of 175 bps. We said at the Capital Markets Day that the result or effect from a number of differe nt  capital efficiency initiatives should deliver or should deliver 80 bps to 125 bps over the next five quarters. And we  also gave you some indication about the split on the fourth quarter and the remaining fourth quarter in 2016."

So, we  actually had two businesses FPE Seals and M Seals performing really quite strongly and that focused on markets  in the UK, Scandinavia and also the Netherlands. Good growth in both the aftermarket and the industrial OEM  Seals businesses. So FPE Seals concentrates mostly on aftermarket and some MRO applications, maintenance  repair, overall type operations. M Seals focuses more on the industrial OEM Seals customers. But both of them  saw some good growth. We also saw some recovery in demand from oil and gas markets, and both FPE Seals  and M Seals supply into that North Sea oil sector, and after a couple of more difficult years we saw a little bit of  growth coming back there. And also, extended our Seals business into Finland."

And the ocean freight market is consolidating strongly. This also has a  rate fluctuation which sometimes is not so much easy to understand, but will keep us busy going forward. So,  what are we doing against these short-term challenges? So, in the overall air freight environment, looking at the  capacity and the all-time high buying rates that we have, we've done a few things in order to make sure that we  can better buy and keep the block space for longer times. We bought more block space agreement this year than  we did the year before to have a more stable buying side."

The only issue  that we see is going forward the discipline, if they get better discipline, the rates will go up. And right now, the  discipline is not there as it should be, so rates go up and down. It's very volatile right now. So, we had also to take  a hit on the ocean freight side. But we believe that with the measurements that we have or based on the  relationship, based on the strategy around it, and also once in a while looking to make sure that we can get better  spot rates outside of these five controlling mixes, we are able to manage this very well.

When the global market was in  surplus, what we saw was a lot of these surplus LNG try to find a home and one of the places it found a home was  in the U.K. And what that did is depress the U.K. gas prices \u2013 gas price.

The other thing which I think is really interesting about the Roadmap  is it lays a picture for what government thinks is going to be a likely range for renewable electricity sourcing in  2020.

So that shakes the biomass down into the underground conveyor  system. That is then transferred through the conveyor system and up into that transfer tower you see on the  diagram. The transfer tower then moves the biomass into a sampling building which does what it says really. We  take samples of the biomass from that point for technical and regulatory purposes."

In  terms of the biomass business, in terms of the coal business, it's a relatively short-term hedge, and when we hedge  what we do is we sell the power and we match that with the coal and carbon position, so we fix the margin.

And as I think most of you know, we have a very well established sustainability policy. And there are two key  components to sustainable biomass. One is that you buy your biomass from a truly sustainable source and what  we mean by that is there is no depletion in the carbon stock. One of the easiest ways to illustrate that is through a  forest."

The second key criteria is that with  the biomass does not have such high bio \u2013 carbon cost and in fact we're not delivering savings. And what \u2013 to  understand that, you need to measure the carbon cost of the biomass, the full lifecycle analysis from the field of  forest all the way to this furnace. We do that, we're actually in our fifth year of carbon foot-printing of all our  biomass and the biomass we burn delivers at least 80% carbon savings relative to coal.

As we drove towards the conclusion  of our three-unit conversion plans, I'm pleased to confirm that we remain on schedule and within budget to  deliver this commitment. Throughout this major transformation, we've delivered good operational performance,  supplying around 8% of the country's power requirements and making a major contribution to UK electricity  system stability. We're supplying increasing levels of biomass generation, and we'll save 12 million tonnes of  carbon per annum when the transformation is complete.

I'll also give you a sense of the key drivers for the remainder of 2018. And these  are the bullet points at the bottom of the slide. So, if we go to the waterfall diagram at the top, Power Generation  was low due to three areas. Firstly, biomass generation where we had two biomass outages in the first quarter.  The first of these was a fire at our biomass rail unloading facilities at the end of 2007, which extended into  January and restricted biomass operations on two ROC units. The second was a non-biomass-related generator  outage in February, again, on one of the ROC units."

In  the U.S., Pellet Production has been strong, increasing volumes of wood pellets produced and sold by 80%,  driving revenue growth and EBITDA of \u00a310 million versus the \u00a34million loss in the first half of 2017."

We really did deliver operational  excellence, good safety performance, very good plant reliability, and fuel flexibility, and during the  year, we bought our supply business, Haven, and it delivered the growth that we had bought it  deliver, to be honest. The near-term value of Drax has been underpinned we feel by the strong  hedge that we set in place with marked acceleration in 2009. And this hedge is not just for 2010,  but is also an increased level for 2011 and 2012. Those margins are executed at spreads better  than the site spreads we secured in 2009. The business is well positioned for the future with a  robust capital structure, good expansion potential for direct supply through Haven and our  dedicated biomass business is progressing well."

We delivered an 89% availability and a 68% load factor,  slightly lower load factor than prior year and this really reflects the fact that for most of the year, the  gas plant was running ahead of the coal plant in the U.K. system."

This really does impact  how we run the plant, because it\u2019s in this low-spread environment that you really need to use a  reliability and flexibility to capture the real value of Drax. So what I thought I\u2019d do is walk you  through some typical sort of generation profiles in a low-spread period and that\u2019s what these two  graphs show. Each of them cover a 48-hour period, starting at midnight. So it runs through part for  a night, a day, a full night and the beginnings of an evening.

What the dark blue line  shows is our contracted power sales; and what the up and down sort of lighter blue lines show is  our activity in the balancing mechanism. If we take the first one, this is a really good example where  the spreads are very low in the overnights, but not low enough to make it economic to turn off and  incur shutdown and startup costs. So, what you have is you have a profile whereby you run pretty  well minimum load overnight around 200 megawatts and then for the extended peak we come up to  full load, run full load during the day on extended peak with a bit of bouncing around during the day  because there is obviously been an opportunity within the day to make more money by coming  down and then come back down to this minimum around 200-megawatt level overnight and come  back up for the extended peak, all the time being active in the balancing market."

We believe this along with the flexibility  illustrated in both these graphs is going to be of increasing importance in coming years and that  really is the feature how the power sector is developing. We think the recent contract we executed  with National Grid really shows the value or beginning of the value of this flexibility. That\u2019s a  contract we have executed for \u2013 half the capacity of Drax for the summer overnights. What we have  agreed with National Grid is when we run mid-load and we\u2019ll remunerate to pull this in the summer  overnights and what this gives them is across those three units, a very powerful frequency  response. What it means is we can go up to 270 megawatts or down 200 \u2013 210 megawatts in just  10 seconds and it\u2019s that response that they need and really value in the overnight."

Well, what we normally show you when we look at  the spreads is we normally compare the baseload dark green spread \u2013 power, less coal, less  carbon, with the baseload green spark spread \u2013 power, less gas, less carbon. What we thought  probably was more appropriate in this presentation was to show you the two different types of  market spreads that we look at, and there are others, but this is probably the most important two.  One is the baseload dark green spread and this is shown in the context of across the forwards from  the beginning of last year to the current forwards. The second shows you the weekday peak dark  green spread and this is where we expect to capture the significant margin over the dark \u2013 over the  baseload dark green spread, and what you can see here is the difference between the two spreads.  As you think of Drax going forward, you really need to think between those two spreads, and to be  honest, it also has to be the extended peak in the overnight and then initially we think of the whole  equation because we\u2019re no longer a simple baseload-running plant."

The reason why the sales are so  high is that the products that are really liquid in the forward markets are the baseload power  products. And so what we tend to do is we tend to oversell baseload power, and then as we get  closer in on the year, we buyback the overnights and create the shape. So, what we expect is to  actually be selling some \u2013 buying back some of the power we\u2019ve already sold. And Tony is going to  take you through the full detail of how we did that in 2009."

What we\u2019re now looking at is across the  two years since the recession really bit is about a 7% reduction in demand. What the top graph  shows is for 2008 \u2013 2007, \u201808, \u201809 weather-adjusted demand and that\u2019s where you can see very  clearly the reduction in demand."

This  includes power buybacks of Drax, power purchases of Haven and grid charges in both businesses.  It should be noted that previously we have classified grid charges for Drax within operating costs. In  fact, grid charges for Drax are marginally down year-on-year. However, the additional grid charges  incurred by Haven lead to an overall increase for the grid of \u00a38 million. Within cost of sales, 693  million related to fuel costs compared to 858 million last year, a reduction of 19%. Excluding  carbon, the average cost of fuel was \u00a325.40 per megawatt-hour, broadly level year-on-year."

Including carbon, average fuel  costs were \u00a332 per megawatt-hour, down \u00a31.80 on last year. Carbon has drifted lower, the average  cost of our purchased carbon, some \u00a33 per ton less than last year. Coal accounted for 88% of the  fuel burned, down 7% from 2008 supported by another reasonable year of biomass in the mix of  3% of total by \u201808; but also petcoke, which at 7% of the total reflects the relative discount of this fuel  to coal during last year. In the current market, this discount is eroded. Pond fine, a byproduct coal  mining, was 1% of that fuel mix at around 100,000 tons, compared to nil in 2008. Pond fine has  traded at a 33% discount to coal and our ability to handle this more difficult fuel is a helpful  contributor to the economics of Drax."

As the chart shows, we made  significant contribution through bilateral buybacks. This is where we have sold forward at a certain  price, but the economics mean it is more profitable to meet our obligation by buying this power back  in the market rather than generate. This is a marginal cost decision, which we take closer to the  point of dispatch. We can trade in this way because of the flexibility we have to turn generation up  or down very quickly. Our units can move from the minimum export limits of 200 megawatt-hours to  the maximum stable export limits of 645 megawatts within 40 minutes, huge flexibility. Within these  short windows, we derive further revenue from the balancing mechanism used by the grid to  balance the system, close to real time. In tight markets and 2010 is shaping up to be another year  we call it margin. This flexibility plays a more important role in the overall financial performance of  Drax."

As noted earlier, we have  stripped our grid charges from operating expenses and these are now included in gross profit. So,  there are several important factors to note. Haven operating costs are some \u00a312 million, which are  clearly not in last year\u2019s comparative. We undertook one plant outage in 2009 compared to two in  2008. This reduced costs by around \u00a316 million, leaving the balance of cost, \u00a314 million less than  2008, a reduction comfortably ahead of the 10 million target we set at the beginning of the year."

Progression of our plans is dependent on securing appropriate ROC  support and proving a strong investment case.  So looking at the principal components to this potential investment, Dorothy described the two phases of the  development of our biomass capacity. The first, enhancing our current facilities with additional storage to enable  enhanced co-firing qualification, which secures the benefit of our existing co-firing investment and generates a  healthy return in its own right.

The power market trades about four seasons forward, but when you get to season three and four,  liquidity drops quite dramatically. We, actually with the introduction of the UK carbon tax, have almost put a limit  on that because actually the carbon tax is always only announced in the budget. So that means that today, we don't  know what is going to be the carbon tax in summer 2015, which means if you choose to sell power in summer  2015, you're taking a risk on what will actually be the carbon tax."

We're going to deliver  excellent performance and this performance is going to surpass our expectations at the time we put together our  investment proposition for this biomass transformation.

What's becoming very clear to us is there is real value for  Drax in having our own pellet production and so maybe if I go on a bit and talk a bit about that."

Project's going very well, on-time and budget and I thought you  might have a bit of a chuckle at the ports \u2013 the technical solution for the port.

What we also haven't mentioned today  but I'll mention now is we know now that the flexibility of these units were miracle in terms of range, but what  actually we're expecting is a faster response time. So that will be very good for a market with increased  intermittent generation."

In delivering this, we have absorbed an  additional \u00a359 million of carbon tax, the UK's carbon price support mechanism, which is levied in our coal  generation. This leads to underlying earnings per share of \u00a30.237 to having a dividend of \u00a30.119 per share or \u00a348  million. This is in line with our policy to distribute 50% of underlying earnings and incorporates a final dividend  of \u00a30.072 per share or \u00a329 million.

There were two strong drivers in that: one was some very challenging commodity  markets, particularly in the beginning of the year; and also the loss of income from Levy Exemption Certificates.  Within our Generation business, we had a very good operational year. We were pleased to finally secure state aid  approval for the CfD in December, and also to finally complete the conversion of our third unit. 65% of our  generation was from biomass, which we were very pleased with. What was good about the Generation business  is that we really did capture value from our flexibility and reliability, supporting system stability, and that was a key  mitigant in those downward factors of the commodity markets [indiscernible] (01:57) and also the delay to the  approval of the CfD."

So during the course of 2018, there were several reports that were  issued that described what were the pathways that we might use to get to a world that only would warm 1.5 or 2  degrees. All of them start with electrification as a sort of key part of the puzzle. And just to give you one thought, I  saw McKinsey report last week that noted that the demand for electricity is growing 7 times faster the demand for  other forms of power globally."

We have a target of growing that to 30%. And ultimately that may  grow further over time. And there's multiple ways in which we're reducing cost. So, one is by reducing feedstock  cost which is primarily about using more effectively sawmill residues and sawdust as opposed to thinnings coming  out of the forest. And an example of what we're doing there is the co-location of the Hunt Forest Products sawmill  next to our pellet plant in LaSalle. That's now, that's happened. They are actually up and running and actually  producing lumber and actually giving us residues item. And so, that's a very attractive low-cost source of  feedstock for the LaSalle plant."

So, by basically reconnecting LaSalle to the rail network in the southeast of the U.S. and not trucking the  pellets to Baton Rouge, we end up with a significant lower cost of transport. And again, as Andy mentioned,  roughly speaking, a third of the overall cost, we delivered pellet is in the transport. So, this has a significant  benefit, reducing the cost per tonne by as much as $10, right."

We had some very, very large  shipments last year. In the quarter, we had some full charter flights.

We have seen a relatively big increase in profitability per unit in both air freight and sea freight, which actually is  very satisfactory and it has happened as to our expectation. So we're very pleased to see that.

That is only matched by a very  few market players, so I think we can be very pleased with that.

But because of the fact that we have been in a very,  very busy quarter, probably the busiest of the year, we \u2013 for competitive reasons, it has not been possible for us to  obtain the same savings by our suppliers, by our holders, meaning that the GP margin had been squeezed a little  bit.

We have also renamed what we use to call energy process and utility, it's so  called now Energy & Materials, because the materials part is all the upstream and downstream activities in fact.

And if that  turns out to be the case, we believe the revenue growth objectives we have set are workable for the whole 2012.  Third, we have constructed our budget so that investment spending is aligned with our revenue outlook. Here  again, we think this is a better approach rather than trying to undo investment plans later in the year because the  environment weakened. And this helps ensure we meet our operating margin objective."

We're still waiting for one in the Czech Republic later on  this year. The differential between the Czech run rate and the euro rate is now a quite substantial one.

This is driven mostly by the increase that we expect in the commodity prices and obviously based  on a lot of sector experts and market consensus.

I'll talk a little bit about the value of that. The  rest of it basically CCGTs and coal. If you look at it, most of our coal either already has the emission standards, the  DeNOx investments made or has them in, in course. So, they will typically have a longer life than the average coal  fleet. And in our hydro, as you know, a lot of them are new plants. So, they have a relatively large residual useful  life.

The fact that we have a higher residual value means that we deserve a higher multiple on our  generation portfolio. How do we interpret this graph? Basically, if we take our average peer's portfolio as being  100, we have more hydro and the hydro typically has a higher multiple than the average because it has a much  larger useful life. So, that obviously skews our portfolio towards a higher multiple. Our coal also has a longer  useful life for the reasons I've mentioned, that we've already done or are doing most of the DeNOx investments.  So, again, we have higher life in our coal."

The first is typically hydro has a higher realized price, around 10%. This is just a function of the fact that it  provides ancillary services and particularly can be profiled on an hourly basis, and so you can really choose the  best hours."

And we see that in the first quarter, EDP continued to invest in this  area and the installed capacity grew 3% year-on-year. So, we basically added approximately 600 megawatts of  wind and solar capacity and 200 megawatts of hydro. So, with this, the renewable energy altogether reaches a  weight more than 70%, both in installed capacity and in overall production."

So,  this showed a very positive performance in the first quarter, particularly in local currency, increasing by 18%. This  was mostly to do with the integrated energy management, so how we managed our contracted and non- contracted volumes as well as just general overall operational performance. And we really see this coming  through in the high availability of Pec\u00e9m, our coal power plant, which increases 4% availability to 98%, which is  we think as pretty good a number, and also by the reduction of distribution grid losses in both the distribution  networks in Espirito Santo and then in S\u00e3o Paulo area."

So, the  EBITDA excluding that falls by 23%, reflecting mostly the \u20ac44 million cut in regulated revenue in Portugal, which  we knew as of December. This was partially offset by 7% OpEx decrease and a 4% growth in volumes  distributed, which I think once again in terms of the underlying performance of the OpEx and the volumes I think is  positive.

And here, this has a triple effect, the lower rain in Iberia. First, less revenue in  liberalised activities. The second impact is we have already completed new hydros, but the lack of water means  that they will start later than expected on a normal year. And third, of course, low rain has caused slower wi nd,  lower volatility on the pool, lower energy management possibilities that were very, very strong in the first  semester last year. And as you can see, wind and hydro represented in the first half 65% of the generation mix  compared to almost 80% in the same period for last year. So, climate change in this semester is really impacting  the figures."

We saw a gradual improvement of  hydro resource in Iberia since the beginning of the year and after two very dry months of January and February,  hydro production for the first nine months managed to improve to 20% above historical average. This compares to  a very dry period last year, which justifies 87% increase year-on-year of the hydro production. On the other hand,  as I've mentioned, over the first nine months this year, wind resources evolved in the opposite direction reaching  the bottom in the third quarter or six years record low with wind resources being 11% below the long-term  average."

So I think here a very strong focus on cost reduction, OpEx efficiency and that's  definitely something we will maintain going forward.

The  first word that I would like to use is, of course, in a tough environment especially due to challenging Iberian  market conditions not only in terms of demand but also in terms of the regulation as everybody can recognize but  also due to non-recurrent items in Brazil, we presented resilient results, with a decrease of 3% on EBITDA to \u20ac3.6  billion. Of course, these negative effects on Iberian market and especially non-recurrent in Brazil that, all along  the year, people were not even mentioning whenever we met in one-on-ones on any conference, everybody was  keeping this \u2013 always on the bright side. But non-recurrent items exist. It was strongly compensated but not  totally by healthy growth in renewables. So, once again, resilience due to the portfolio effect. So, if in 2011 the  bright news were coming out of Brazil this year, the good news were coming from renewables sector,  compensating mainly for the lower Brazilian figures.  In this year, we have a division of 880 megawatts, typically, wind, hydro in Brazil. Two-thirds of which in new  hydro and wind. So, clearly, keeping the same focus on value-creation projects on these two technologies that, as  you know, in terms of earnings are more protected than other technologies."

This reflects hydro  production coming to normalized levels, so hydro factor in Portugal was very close from 1 in the first two months  of the year, and that renewables production increasing not only due to new installed capacity but also due to very  strong wind resources in January and February. Also, there is further demand decline, contributes to this lower  production of thermal generation in the period."

In terms of outlook for regulatory receivables in Portugal. So, we maintained the evolution as expected. So, we  expect an increase in the region of \u20ac500 million in 2013. In terms of the first two months of the year, I would  highlight on the positive side in the hydro production which is much better than last year; tariff increases that  were fully implemented; market liberalization with number of clients in free markets increasing faster than  expected. On the negative side, of course, demand, which is slightly worse than expected, nevertheless expected  utilization during the year to minus 2% in 2013. And all the measures that were offered by the government in May  were already implemented, so the cuts on CMEC, capacity payment, cogeneration and the wind agreement.

This was much  minimized by the hedges that we did, that we had hedging going up \u20ac14 million. But this was impacted by the low  pool prices, low pool prices that were affected by weather conditions, namely the very high load factors in wind.  And also, technicality, but this is important for you to understand that because of the very low pool prices, we  should have an adjustment of more of \u20ac12 million on the regulatory adjustment because of the difference between  pool prices and the lower limits. But we didn't have it because this is the last year of the three-year regulatory  period. And given what is in the regulation, the average of the baseload pool price is being calculated starting in  October 15 through October 16 (sic) [March 16] (00:10:04).

And also, there was a contract that has moved from PPA  to non-PPA, and that was an impact here on the PPA and non-PPA selling price.

First of all, I mean, just by the fact that we  are lowering the CapEx cost as well as the increasing the useful life for the new installation, the levelized cost of  energy tends to go further down. And also on the right hand side of this page, you see that when you compare the  levelized cost of energy of wind with other technologies, namely with conventional technologies, as long as you  include all the costs, investment in O&M, fuels, CO2 and dismantling, as long as you include all these costs,  effectively wind is a competitive technology within the energy metrics.  This number that we have here is based on a NCF north of 25%. But it really reflects to me the perspective that if it  is a competitive technology, it should mitigate the perceived risk that currently some investors have in their mind  towards the \u2013 to what extent can these targets that have been setup by different countries, namely in Europe, can  be supported in such an environment, in a certain environment both from economical as well as environmental  perspective."

And so that  requires a demand, but besides that and perhaps this is a less obvious sometimes it's not having [indiscernible]  (00:27:49) consideration is that wind today is even with shale gas competitive. If we look at the graph on page 27  on the right-hand side, you can see that which shows that what is the load sector, which is competitive with the  gas prices for different prices of gas? You see that load factors over 40% are competitive even with shale gas  prices of about $4 or $5 per million of Btu. And this is really very important. And so what we saw last year and we  expect to continue to see in the future is that [indiscernible] (00:28:26) of USA, where the load factors are very  high over 40% will tend to choose more and more wind, acquisition of wind not because it's green but because it's  cheaper and this is true to the United States when we are looking at gas prices of $3, $4, $5 per million of Btu, if  you think about European price meaning $9, $10, $11 and you move to the right side of the graph, you see that  load factors of 25%, 28%, 30% are competitive. So that's why I gave that remark before. Europe is going to be a  minority, in terms of our investments today because there is a very strong opportunity in United States, but  Europe is not bad. And so, we should be able to continue to create the options for the future and not leaving the  European markets."

We started the  year very well in terms of wind resource then throughout the year is evident that there is a deviation and the last  quarter was the poorest quarter in terms of deviation vis-\u00e0-vis the P50."

And also some  dilution on the price given that the new megawatts are much more competitive with a lower CapEx than the old  ones, higher load factors and external [indiscernible] (00:09:51) dilution on the price for the same target return  that we target for every new project."

As Richard said, we're striving for more even quarters during the year  and, accordingly, net sales in Q4 was flat compared with last year. Q4 gross margin was down 1.1 percentage  points which, from my perspective, is lower than expected. The deviation is related to higher third-party revenues  with low margin as well as we didn't achieve all of our expected COGS savings before year-end. Expenses were  down compared to last year and EBITA grew 18% to SEK 918 million or 25.4% margin. Net profit was SEK 544  million and earnings per share SEK 1.42."

But  now if I were to walk you through the technology a bit, you will see it's pretty simple. Fog is made up of a lot of  tiny droplets of water. And they generate this fog film on your lenses. With the Optifog layer, you're going to be  able to distribute these water droplets and create a very thin film that the wearer will not see and, therefore, fog  tends to disappear. And if you look at the figures, you're better at math than I am, but at a 1.6 billion people using  corrective lenses today, we need to conquer at least 2.4 billion more. 75% of 1.6 billion customers want to have a  no-fog solution, so plenty of work for the future. So 2.4 billion more will also be needing a no-fog solution. With  this type of technological revolution, we're going to be able to leverage a price differential as well and this means  that we're going to be looking at the top end of the pyramid.

If you don't purchase those lens,  your eyes are not properly protected against UV rays. Even though on the market, where you often have heard for  a long time about 100% protection, it wasn't true.

And we started off at the top. So it enabled us to  start to educate the market. That was very important to invest in marketing campaigns, educational campaigns  that create an awareness about the dangers of UV rays. And sometimes people have the wrong idea about this. So  we do these at in-stores, in the media and so on. People think that when there's no sun, there are no UV rays.  That's wrong. That's false. It's probably a misconception. People think that UV rays are less dangerous for the eyes  than for the skin. It's false. It's the opposite actually. And then clear lenses can't protect against daily UV exposure.  That's true. So through the true and false awareness creation mechanisms, we start to educate people and people  start to get the point. So that then we can start entering the mid-tier and the lower part of the market. So the first  thing we've already started doing this, the BBGR network with the Neva brand and some major chains like in  Australia OPSM, which is a leading brand for the distribution of eyewear.

This tariff review applies  retroactively since April 2011. The amounts cashed in excess will be returned in the following years.

Before I summarize this presentation, allow me to briefly make three points, that I shared with  Endesa's shareholders at our Annual General Meeting two weeks ago. The first is that Endesa fully backs the  Spanish Government's commitment at the COP21 Summit in Paris to drastically reduce CO2 emissions and will be  at the forefront of the electrification of Spanish energy sector."

The regulated businesses performed as expected providing a stable result. Out of the total gross margin  and EBITDA figures, they contributed with 57% and 70% respectively. Secondly, net of the CO2 swap transaction  of last year, liberalized business show very good results, supported by our successful energy management strategy  we started to implement a long time ago. In terms of fixed costs, they remained flat underpinned by efficiency  plans. All-in-all, first quarter results show us that Endesa is well on track to meet the target communicated to the  market."

The main events affecting the Iberian business were the  increase of wholesale prices that resulted in a normalization of the liberalized business margin. During this first  half of the year we recorded higher cost of energy purchases reflecting the increase in wholesale prices and  subsequently margins in the liberalized business have adjusted to a level, which is both lower and definitely more  sustainable. In fact based on the pretty sharp increases in prices recorded in the second half of 2010, we should  now consider that most of the reduction in margins has materialized and therefore in the second half of the year  we should be recording spreads in line with the first half of 2011."

Both these two natural events have substantially conditioned, the energy mix employed in  the period. Generation output in Chile which dropped by 9% in first half 2011 to 9,188 gigawatt hours was  characterized by a decrease in hydro production of 1.5 terawatt hours that is 26% lower than in 2010  complemented by an increase in thermal output of 586 gigawatt hours. Energy purchases more than doubled last  year's figures and additionally those purchases were made at substantially higher prices.  All in all the draught in Chile affected our Chilean operations in generation by \u20ac136 million at EBITDA level, as  Paolo will explain later on. We would also draw your attention to the dollar evolution against the euro over the last  18 months. The depreciation of the dollar in the first semester had a negative impact in our dollarized business for  the first time in several quarters. And lastly we would like recall the one-off effect in Colombia, already mentioned  recorded in the first quarter where we have fully recognized a net worth tax that amounts to \u20ac109 million that will  be paid in eight six-month installments between 2011 and 2014."

Elimination of retroactivity,  the establishment of a remuneration level that allow a certain amount of value creation with respect to the cost of  capital, the explicit inclusion of taxes arising from Law 15/2012 in the costs to be taken into account when  calculating regulated return."

I would  like to start mentioning the main factors behind the first half 2013 results in Spain and Portugal. First, Endesa's  liberalized and regulated business margin, were very negatively affected by the regulatory measures taken in 2012  and the previously-mentioned measures taken so far in 2013. On the other hand, Endesa's mainland generation  output significantly fell by 21% mainly explained by the 55% of thermal output decrease as a result of the thermal  gap drop experienced during the period. On the contrary, Endesa's hydro production sharply increased to close to  6 terawatt hours."

Despite lower generation output as we saw and selling  prices mainly in Spain and Chile, overall in the nine months, revenues have increased by 23%.  Mainly due to firstly, the changes in revenues in the method of registration in Spain since mid 2009  as a consequence of market liberalization as we are now booking the total price paid by final  customer including both the tolling and the energy component.

We\u2019re pretty sure that there can be no doubt whatsoever that  the solution to the issue of eliminating the deficit goes through a non-negligible increase of the so  called access tariffs. Everybody knows \u2013 everybody is aware of this and we believe that the  regulator is prepared to implement tariff increases. To mitigate the level of these increases,  nevertheless, there are a number of measures which are possible, such as a stricter control on the  development of subsidies to the renewables energies, but above all, the sharing of these subsidies  with the other energy sectors. Definitely, in this context, there is no room whatsoever for taxes on  things such as the alleged windfall profits simply because these windfall profits do not exist. But I  am sure that we will have the chance to elaborate a little bit more of these issues later on during  our Q-and-A session."

The  panel is also likely to propose recommendations and ways to simplify and accelerate procedures for  environmental permitting of new generation projects and on third-party access to LNG terminals.

The main factors driving  results in Latin America were the resilience in the region to the current global economic crisis.

Generation output increased by 5% when compared to the same period  of 2011, basically explained by the better hydro conditions registered in Brazil and Colombia."

The Enersis divestment was carried out at its highest  valuation in the last three years. As a consequence of this transaction, the company has now refocused on its  position as the leading utility in the Iberian market, with the presence across a whole energy value chain."

Firstly, demand in mainland Spain adjusted for working dates and temperature effects slightly  increased with respect to 2013, improving the change of trend initiated some months ago. This increase was again  supported by the investor segment, with demand increasing by 2.4% on an unadjusted basis."
