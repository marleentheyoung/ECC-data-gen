We have the flexible PLSV business and EPIC and lump-sum projects,  which are largely driven by Petrobras' pre-salt development. Starting my comments with the PLSV, it's mainly a  day-rate business with limited project execution risk. We expect this market to grow in the coming years as  Petrobras needs more vessels for flexible pipe installation, both for their pre-salt and post-salt projects."

We don't do the mini-submarine thing, but actually most of the pumps, most of the new watering pumps that  were involved in taking the water level down in the cave in Thailand were actually Sulzer pumps. And this is what  you see on these pictures. These blue pumps are the watering pumps. The reason why they were chosen is that  our local distributor was very reactive and diligent and went up to help, but also because their light aluminum  structure and the challenge was that you needed pumps that could take out huge volumes of water but that were  also light enough to be transported by people into a remote place and this is what you see on pages 2 and 3. So,  once again, a very touching story that ended well and Sulzer was happy to play a small role in all of this."

Waste water activity, and that's why you have the arrow going down, was a bit slower in 2011 compared to 2010,  and this is mainly driven by two circumstances. First of all, there was a certain weakness in the Spanish market, a  very strong market for Cardo Flow Solutions, due to the economic situation in Spain.

But he made a really good point on his conference call a few weeks ago; asked about the  cost savings and the eroding profitability and when that turns around. And the message he gave and I think the  message that fully applies to Sulzer is that these actions were structural and that yes we are fighting headwinds  that lead to volume erosion and we're not fully countering that volume erosion at this point. But I think the  expression he used was, a tightly compressed coiled spring and I think it's a good image. We're compressing that  cost structure. And when the market starts picking up again, and it will, we  will be in a great position to actually  reap the benefits of everything that we are doing now. So we're mitigating current headwinds, but we are also  building the future."

And the dark blue is what we've achieved as a P&L impact to -date. Once again, this is \u2013 there's a  P&L impact as you can imagine, because this program is a year old. If you have a CHF 36 million P&L impact in  year one that probably means that you have close to twice that potential in terms of run rate, right? Because you  get some of the benefit from the actions that happened right at the beginning of the year and the actions that  happened at the end of the year don't really materialize as a P&L impact in the first year.

Companies have this tendency to  kind of redo their allocations from time to time to say, well, this business is more like this and not like that.

So,  your question could be, well, your new equipment business in oil and gas is eroding. Why isn't the aftermarket  going up? Reason for that is that our Tower Field Services in Chemtech counts significantly in the aftermarket  number. And Tower Field Services is an aftermarket business, but it's an aftermarket business which is unusual.  It's very lumpy, so it's outages, customers don't want to do an outage or turnaround.

The upstream market was down in 2016. It will be down  again in 2017, by the way. Our customers invested less in this area. Fewer projects means higher competition,  and therefore, a lot of price pressure.

And following the severity of the last three winters, we have increased our network  replacements activity, and our infrastructure renewals have increased period-on-period. As you can see on the  chart, unplanned interruptions has benefited from that investment, showing a reduction in rates, compared to the  start of the year. On leakage, we are on target year to date, and indeed, as the winter approaches, we have already  put in place additional resources to deal with the challenges that the cold weather can represent, so prudent  approach to maintaining investment in our network to maintain serviceability."

Firstly, with our strong start on customer ODIs this year, we're confident that  we'll beat our performance last year and earn at least \u00a350 million in net outperformance payments. Most of our  ODI outperformance to date has come from our exceptional Waste performance. The total AMP capped for Waste  ODIs is about \u00a3190 million gross of tax. So, the \u00a375 million we earned in the first two years leaves \u00a3115 million  available for the remaining three years. Based on our performance trajectory on key Waste commitments, we now  believe it will hit this cap."

Quasi taxes, such as rates, abstraction  rights, Ofwat fees, we expect them to rise along with power cost. But we expect that to be offset by  some reduction in bad debt as the economy we hope improves. But all in all, non-controllable cost  will rise by about 7.4%.

The falling in oil prices impacts this broad sector a bit  differently. 40% of the portfolio is impacted positively or neutrally, 60% which is mainly oil and offshore business  is negatively impacted. However, when we look at the portfolio, we have lent money to companies with strong  financials. We have focused on good collateral and conservative loan-to-values.

This is their high voltage module, and when we talk about electric cars  and electric car drivetrain, you need to be able to measure voltages and acquire data from high voltage signals.  And this one will go up to 1,000 volts, which is probably the order of magnitude \u2013 not probably it is the order of  magnitude that electric cars, electric vehicles run on in the sort of 200 volt to 300 volt level.

In this whole mix of costs, which is all cost not just the  OpEx side, this is also including the COGS, the OpEx is strongly down, and I think we're down 9% on OpEx in  Sweden for the quarter. So, it is strong execution from the Swedish team in balancing off the costs while investing  for growth in the business."

The OTC revenue is around 70% of last year at SEK 239  million, and we have guided, as you know, on a 60% to 90% revenue for OTC this year compared to last year. So,  we are within that range and it's still as uncertain as before depending both on the permit side then, but also on  the delivery and weather side."

Because this is what our society and our political decision  makers want to see not only the more, but the more in a better way and they really drive us by law  and policy making, reduction of CO2 emission is a clear demand on us and also an efficient use of  infrastructure. And, for example, if I just jump on the reduction of CO2 emissions then this through  the way we produce our material.

We need to support these by higher expenses, higher spendings in R&D and  you can see that despite the challenging environment, we have increased our R&D spending by 60%, and also for  the running business we are planning to increasing further, not only spending, we clearly want to allocate it to  growth opportunities and differentiation potentials. And we also tackle new areas. As you can see here, for  example, the TechCenter for carbon composites, which we have established very new, we do not believe that, one,  either steel or carbon composite will win. We do believe that going forward we will have intelligent combinations  of both materials. And in order to secure what we are investing, we have also established new processes for our IP  management.  Naturally, it's a little bit challenge that we have to do this fundamental transformation of our company  ThyssenKrupp in an environment which is not giving any tailwind. On the contrary, if you look on the  development of GDP for both years 2012 and 2013, all the information we can take show a downward correction  for nearly all the regions. Clearly, the most severe situation we face in the euro zone and we are very happy that  China and India despite some discussions are continuing to provide growth opportunities on a very, very high- level.

What is also pleasing is that  the net underwriting result has also been up and the operating result is nearly twice as high as in the first quarter  2013. Please do bear in mind that the combined ratios that you see for the first quarter still sort of buffered in  some of the potentially adverse environmental developments in the Nat Cat large loss environment that we may  see in the future quarters.

The worst hit area was actually northern parts of \u2013 the northern part of North Rhine Westphalian  including the Ruhr valley. Now, if you compare this map and look at the sums insured that we've got in our  property business in Retail Germany, you'll find that there are two areas in Germany where we are heavily  exposed and that's the [indiscernible] (00:24:14) region, and that is the northern part of North Rhine Westphalian."

From the highlights to assorted  items and some segmental details, I'd like to kick off with page 13 and that is an overview of large losses that had  to be digested by us in the last year. The total amount stood at \u20ac922 million which is quite a lot. I think the three  key takeaways you \u2013 like we could draw from that. A, it's been higher than \u2013 well, roughly, same size as 2014 but  well within our budget at the group level which I think is important. And third, if you look at the structure of large  losses that we were exposed to, it's been a year that was relatively benign in terms of natural catastrophes that  saw quite a lot of manmade incidents. And that is through both for the primary as well as the reinsurance sector.  The total loss of the Tianjin last stood at \u20ac154 million at group level and that was certainly one of the most  significant claims in last fiscal year"

Therefore a lot of emergency actions are  taking place right now and we are, with our, technologies in a good position to support both our clients and the  national systems to improve that. So as a result of this, Sorting Solutions is in recycling has experienced a  moment of very strong market momentum. This will not last forever, but as we see it right now historically and for  the near future, we see continuous good momentum here. So as result, very strong development in order intake  in recycling."

We also see that our  automation solutions for the food industry are sought after. Our customers they need to improve their quality.

Some have sought shelter, if I say so in trying to export to other markets like Malaysia, like Vietnam, like  Indonesia. These markets are challenged by this situation.

It was slightly lower in this quarter here in the first quarter.

So, we can do that so successfully is really something  that is generating great values, not only to the business, but also to a more sustainable world."

If you look back  here a little bit,  especially in recycling, last couple of years has been somewhat slower. We experienced reduced activity level  last year in recycling and that was much driven by the commodity situation. Oil price, you might recall, went down  from around \u2013 above $100 at least per barrel down to something around $40 per barrel and $50 per barrel. And  our customers, those who process plastic to sell that as a new resource are, of course, competing there with  virgin material, and if the virgin material comes down so drastically under such short time that creates a big  problem for the industry."

So, recycling, I see that we have seen a recovery in the market, and we see  that we are in a positive momentum."

Being able to sort them already at the mine enables you to remove those rocks that do not  contain the mineral you are looking for.

So, in fact they can look at fairly big rocks and sort them out, so that if there is a  big diamond there, you don't go through a very standard crushing, you will treat that piece of rock in a different  way and by that you can also uncover this beautiful gemstone. And so, we saw an opportunity, we dev eloped the  technology and we find a partner in the industry who saw that this is an opportunity for them and that was the  success. And I tell you this because this is very often the way we grow in the Sorting business. We have an  excellent and very broad technology platform. I dare to say that we have the broadest and strongest technology  platform in the whole industry. And one of the reason of course is that we have merging the technologies from  different sectors. We have laser, which we have from Food, which we can also use in Mining and in Recycling. We  have infrared which traditionally comes from Recycling, which we now use extensively in Food, and we have X- ray, which we actually use across. There are differences in the X-ray because of course you have much higher X- ray energy levels here than you would look into food objects. But we still work with the same kind of technology  and cross \u2013 can crossbreed the learnings we make here."

There will be a new market demand growing up here progressively over  time."

Very strong order intake, but still not really into sales. I  mean these are the two areas where actually the sales quarter-on-quarter has gone down quite  dramatically within Engineered Systems, which is then also one of the explanations on why we still  comment on having a negative product mix in engineered and that is linked to the fact that we still  have offshore oil and gas and infrastructure going down in terms of sales and then being replaced  by more industrial sales. But, when we talk about this, we are getting close. We have a very, very  strong order intake both in offshore oil and gas and infrastructure construction.

So, there is, let's say, overall more good movements in some segments. And then we, of  course, we have some other segments which is more dramatically down. If you say then agri or farming  equipment. OE is dramatically down in the quarter, continuous going forward. We have also of course oil and gas  even though we don't see that in sales, but, of course, the sentiment in the oil-and-gas-related activity has changed  dramatically in the quarter, and we also have some niches in Europe, especially in Europe, and general industry  niches in Europe were also \u2013 has been quite depressed for us in the quarter."

Now of course, as most of you know, our reinsurance structure means that we carry the first  DKK100 million in claims and then reinsurers carry the rest of the claims. And then, we have to pay an estimate of  roughly DKK90 million in reinstatement premium.

We are seeing that there are different types of, for instance, houses where water risk  is higher. And therefore, our surveying team should spend more time on that.

Our petrol sales grew by over 20% in the first  half, which means three-quarters of \u00a31 billion more spent on petrol in Tesco than in the same period last year,  much of this at the expense of customers' regular shopping."

You don't know when the sun is going to shine. You don't know when it's ripe and what the crop will  be. So we have a demand forecast.

We worked with them very short order. These things happen in days. This might be a Monday  conversation or a Tuesday conversation. We open upon it. We buy all of the crop. There's a marginal cost to the  crop. The farmer gets to sell everything, no waste. We manage to keep a small amount of margin as we go  through.

First quarter production was 2.43  million barrel of oil equivalent a day, an increase of 4.5% compared to the same quarter last year  and more than 2% compared to the previous quarter. Part of the increase is coming from our  energy volumes, which grew by 38% year-over-year. Also, another point to make here is that the  improvement in Nigeria and the reduction related to OPEC\u2019s restriction was positive compared to a  year ago and that\u2019s roughly in line with the fourth quarter.

In the first quarter, the Upstream tax  rate was 60% versus 58 in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter tax rate was below the 2009  average and the first quarter includes some adjustment from last year. The annualized first quarter  Upstream royalty continues to be very competitive at 20%. We are continuing to actively manage  the Upstream portfolio.  In the first quarter, we acquired a 20% share in the Barnett Shale. We  sanctioned the development of Surmont Phase 2 in Canada and the Laggan-Tormore project in the  UK North Sea.  The Gulf project, deep-offshore Angola, has been sanctioned internally and we  expect our partner to report it very soon.

Our average liquid price realization was stable quarter-to-quarter  at $59 per barrel, reflecting mainly the rebound in Canadian differentials. Natural gas, however, was down about  10% from previous quarter to $4.5 per million btu, mainly due to mild weather in the first quarter.

We are  continuing to reshape our portfolio by reducing specialty chemicals with a coming sale of Atotech on one side;  and on the other side, by investing in oil and add Downstream businesses and new energy. We are adding the  GAPCO marketing asset in East Africa; the battery company Saft, and Lampiris; a gas and power distribution  company in Belgium.

We recently signed an agreement with Chesapeake, which give  us access to shale gas assets and which will, for our share, produce something about 30,000  barrels per day starting now."

And was still unlimited, I would say, unused  capacities in the world. So we have as an industry, we have as a company, to accompany this demand for oil and  gas, which means for energy and what we need to do on the top as Total is not only to do it for doing it, but do it  with profit, do it with, as Patrick said, added value to the company, which means to our shareholders.

We'll not change every six months all t he guidelines  that we give you.

And I think it's, by the way, a good philosophy not to go up and down according to the price of oil  but to try to keep a stable strategy and this is what we will try to do, a sustainable and a stable strategy for the  medium term."

With all the strategy of the group since last 15 years and before has been to keep, to  maintain in the company the full value chain on oil, oil and gas, from exploring, producing, transforming,  distributing. And this model which sometimes was discussed is proving today its full efficiency because, of course,  part of the value which are lost in the Upstream has been recovered in the downstream business. As the main  figure which illustrates that is that the downstream cash generation in 2015 has been $8 billion, which is quite an  improvement compared to the $3 billion that downstream was delivering in 2011."

I think the average gas price declined by 25% compared to last year while the oil price was more in the  range of 16%. So, the gas markets have been even lower this year. We know that we face a situation where we  have a lot of supply, in particular LNG supply coming into the market from Australia, from the U.S. One of the  things which we would like to underline is that the demand has been strong because the price was quite low."

So, that proves that in the gas, like in oils when you have lower prices, you accelerate the  demand. It's a good lesson. And another end of it is that you can see on the map the number of projects of  floating storage regasification units which are studied around the world. Today, you have 70 million tons of  floating regas capacities being already installed in the world. And there is more than almost 200 million tons being  studied."

This is a good  message for gas, by the way, and it's not only on FSRU, but we need to work on cost. Also in the LNG plants, we  will target to be able to come back to a $500 per ton of LNG production. It would be good if we want to continue to  develop the gas market. So, the gas market is facing, on one side, quite stronger new supply. But it's also \u2013 this  has an influence on the price. But it also helps the demand to come back. So, result of all of that is that the price  today, during this winter period, are quite good, including in Southeast Asia.

We are also  active in promoting the UN SDGs and I'm one of the 10 pioneers for this year in promoting these principles, and  also working with other oil and gas companies on methane emissions. And it's important as gas is more and more  the core strategy."

And so, what we observe and we rank it in a different way but traditionally is  that, first, you have an increase of natural gas. And this explain why we want to expand along the gas value  chain. But these natural gas increase require that we are able to enhance the demand for gas. That's why it's  important to work not only on gas production but along the full value chain to lower the cost of this value chain  and integrating also its downstream path."

We have steadily increased our sensitivity to Brent and we are  capturing the benefit of the oil price recovery.

With  Petrobras, which is complete today, it would have been 16%. Starting 2018, we will change our gearing definition  to be in line with what is used by our competitors and we will use the debt to capital ratio.

But in fact, for  the time being, this market is growing very quickly, in particular driven by, of course, the policy in China. China  has grown again this year by 40%. It was 40% last year and it was almost 40% three years ago. I don't know if it's  permanent but its anticipation as to very strong natural gas and [indiscernible] (00:10:06) mix of China is still low.  But for, I would say, environmental issues, air quality in big China cities, very strong momentum for LNG, 55  million tons have been imported there this year."

Kaombo, Ichthys, Egina represent in 2019 $3 billion of additional  cash flows at $60. Like the acquisition which have been completed now represent $2.5 billion.

It's fundamentally the strategy of the group is in line to  potential anticipating market trends. We don't know if the world will be able to make a 2-degree scenario. There  are some doubts around the world. But whatever what will happen, there are some market trends in term of new  technologies which we need to take into account, and that means that we need to focus on oil which is again low  breakeven oil because we could face some situation where the world oil demand will be slower, even decline. On  the contrary, there is a strong space for seeing growth for natural gas and that's why we invest more and more in  all the chain of the gas value chain. And the overall characteristics of the demand of energy is that electricity  demand should almost double in the next 20 years coming either from natural gas or from renewables, so it's why  we invest in this low-carbon electricity business."

The project is around 5% to 6%, 7%. That [indiscernible] (00:56:17) is a basis. Then of course,  price in particular in this environment, a way to leverage all these projects.

Actually, we are quite happy that the mix of these is a  little bit smaller on average, it obviously gives you more bang for your buck in terms of the next four or five years  in some of the really large sites.

We've been buying  land, in terms of proportion of apartments between 15% and 20%, for the last two or three years, so it's natural  that that will happen. But I think what's most interesting is that switch out of apartments has not gone into  smaller houses; it's actually gone into a significant increase in larger four-bed or five-bed houses. That's driving  the increase in average square footage and that's driving the increase in average selling price. That's a big shift. To  have a 3% increase in four-bed and five-bed houses in one period is significant. We think it's sustainable. We think  this is probably about the level it will settle down at.

Additional returns will then be made at the right time in the cycle  and will largely be linked to relative reduction in land investment as the market heats up. We will be well placed to  deliver strong operational cash flows.

The KPI that we're looking very closely at, at the moment around build quality is the Construction  Quality Review measure, and this is a key metric for us in measuring build quality, and is assessed independently  by the NHBC and helps us to monitor and target improvements in the build process. The CQR inspections take  place across all build stages present on the site that's been inspected and the visit is followed by a site level  report, which identifies areas of good practice and, of course, areas that maybe in need of attention."

The first quarter of last year included a very strong per formance, reflecting  very high client activity levels that particularly favored our business footprint. In Q1, the Investment Bank  continued to demonstrate prudent risk and resource control in line with very low levels of client activities. On  costs, we made further progress in the quarter with an additional CHF 100 million in reduction."

We recognized a credit loss expense of CHF 17 million  against these exposures, including the effect of establishing a collective provision, taking the  total provisions to  CHF 56 million. The idea exhibited strong expense and resource discipline. Operating expenses, excluding  services to/from were down 26% year-over-year and personnel expenses were down 29%, mainly reflecting lower  expenses per variable compensation."

There were also lower losses from novation and unwind activity as we take a more passive approach to  reducing the remaining exposures. Non-core and Legacy LRD decreased by 11% to CHF 41 billion, mainly due to  lower OTC-derivative exposures.

Number one, we were successful in reformulating a room temperature stable product and that  led to the approval in two markets: U.S. and Europe. And then a third big event happened at the Christmas Day,  which was the approval of Neupro in Japan. So I think 2012 represents certainly an uptick growth year based on  solid performance from a regulatory standpoint, as well as solid performance in the marketplace. You can see the  uptick that really occurred from the United States. There's no impact yet for Japan. I'm pleased to say our partner  Otsuka, which has the exclusive rights, exclusive even as to us in Japan, launched yesterday at a very fine price.

Take for example crude oil, which traded at  around $120 per barrel through March and April, then hit $90 a barrel end of June, and now is again $105 and  rising; or in the U.S., with severe droughts in a large part of the country, already leading to sharp inflated prices  for soybean, corn and wheat prices."

Although I fully realize  that it's hard to move the few remaining glass-is-half-empty guys out there, in this climate, we'll continue to  welcome it."

And it's unfortunate that some of you still don't spend the  necessary time on fully understanding this. From the way we source materials to the way we run our factories,  from the way we develop products to the way we interact with consumers and customers, it is embedded in all we  do. We will say more about it later in the year when we get together at our Investor Conference in Paris."

If you  leave waste in the system, you have less money to support your brands, less money to drive innovations and,  ultimately, less money to return to shareholders. And the waste can take many forms. An unnecessarily complex  range of SKUs will drive an inefficient supply chain, which in turn result in higher costs and often poor customer  service."

Despite the dismal, poor weather conditions in many parts of Europe, Ice Cream sales  have held up well, as we continue to drive innovation through our iconic brands. In China, our 7-minute digital  Cornetto microfilms have been watched 280 million times in the last eight weeks. Now that is really helping  Cornetto, by some distance, our biggest Ice Cream brand in China, which is now growing more than 30% versus  last year."
