This was before exchange; exchange was slightly adverse and although the position of  sterling was improved versus the euro, it was still weak versus the dollar and other major  currencies.

The  actual price of fuel, the average price of fuel was more than 50% higher than it had been a year  previously an average of $723 a ton. Though, much of the effect of this increase was offset by  hedging. Exchange was more or less flat and the results overall that our fuel costs were flat year- on-year \u00a3592 million versus \u00a3596 a year earlier.

And due also to the fact that  certain concessions that have firmly reached expiry are still within our business portfolio.  So we have expanded and prolonged a little bit the depreciation period of some hydro assets. We have then left  some funds of provisions for litigations. We were overprovisions in other words.

Let's start on page 4, and here you can see that that's the picture for  Italy, these are the numbers for the Italian Electricity market. You can see the last line, electricity demand  declined in Q1 compared to the same period last year 4% (sic) -4% (5:45). And I think that on a like-for-like basis  that would be a 2.8% decline. It should be added, however that demand in Q1 2013 is basically at the same level as  Q4 2012. So I would say that the economic scenario had an almost zero impact on these numbers."

So that's the cap, 10 megawatts being the cap. And if we look  back at 2011, there is an interesting number, which can be also expanded to 2012 plant with installed capacity  below 9 megawatt amounts [ph] 200,000 to 400,000 (7:37). So, thanks to the policy to incentivize wind, sun,  hydro and other forms of renewable source. Small scale plants are making up quite strong basis. The installed  capacity corresponding to these plants means that on average each of them has an installed capacity of 0.05  megawatt."

There are very few, very large assets and really a myriad of very small ones. And that really  tells you, how the system is difficult to manage and there is probably no programming or such a thing as planning  of small plants, wind and sun or solar energy plants by their very same nature, it cannot be programmed. But in  any case, this really tells you how unstable the system is with detrimental impact on our network.

It also benefited from the strong increase in hydro generation. On top of that, let me also add  that we're looking at the electricity market, we had forward sales last year selling 2013 production.

So, we have basically 20% up of CCGT volumes and 14% up on the hydro  production, which basically both of them comes of effect mix from plus \u20ac30 million versus 2017, despite a global  decrease in price, if you look at the price scenario in 2017 and the price scenario in 2018. So, very good  performance in terms of volumes."

I'll start with Generation, as you have already seen;  we got a very strong H1 up 20% year-on-year basically, but fueled by stronger prices and spreads with negative  effects if we can say. So, one is definitely lower hydro production, minus 30% in Italy and almost 50% in  Montenegro, and the impacts on the hedging position, you might all recall that we were hedged basically close to  100% on the hydro production and these effects clearly limited the possibility to benefit from very high, especially  two big prices, and especially during Q2."

Then we have \u20ac77 million of loan versus December \u2013 of course, versus the end of  December, \u20ac17 million of lower sale of receivable without recourse.

This year, instead, we did not sell the green certificates long  position.

You may remember that we have given you our goal to triple our customer  base. We can say today that we already doubled our customer base in the free market, so we're very well ahead  in terms of ability to reach the plan.

Waste collection up 20%, 30% (sic) [26%] of inhabitants  served in our core areas.

So if we compare the  Restructure situation in two years ago and today, the duration situation, I believe we have more option than two  years ago. This is why if you go to page 27 and 28, we want to reassess our strategic goals. We consider the  Restructure phase on the generation completed and we want to focus in terms of strategy of a first R or Relaunch.  So the growth in environment networks and energy will become the biggest focus of the company, on businesses  where we do see there's going to be an important growth going forward, where we do have a low risk profile and  we do have a competitive advantage. You will see later on more information on this front."

It means that after the big focus that we have posed on the restructuring of our fleet, I  think there's more room today to play a more active role in the market transformation. How? Basically, to continue  to make our fleet more flexible. We do see going forward in the next, especially four, five years more capacity to  be dismissed in France, in Switzerland, and in Germany. So we do see more opportunity coming from the  shortening of the EU markets going forward. There's a third point, we want to re-align our strategy with the Winter  Package, in other words with the opportunity that will be coming with the gradual implementation of the Winter  Package. This, of course, means several things; it means more renewables, more distributed energy resources,  so mobility and storage and networks. And last but not least, we'll see that more in details in a minute, more  opportunities coming from adjacencies, so the business that are close to the generation."

By the way, let me underline the fact that you have here in this slide in a green circle which says 40%  CapEx in sustainability. You will see in this slide there are costs and systematic references to sustainability of  targets beyond the economic financial targets which is the case for regulated business as well.

I think Valerio mentioned that \u20ac80 million of  EBITDA comes from treatment plants, which are basically treatment plants we have commented on page 16 of  the presentation. \u20ac64 million out of \u20ac80 million are from already authorized plan. So, there is no question mark  related to when we get the authorization."

So, it's just a question to beat them up, which takes time. So, EBITDA will fall in 2022-2023. \u20ac50  million are from other plants which are not subject to authorization. And then we have an important effects which  comes from the assumptions we have done over the price increase both in energy generated by the WTE, this  scenario, as well as we are assuming a 2% increase year-on-year on the prices for Waste, which is once again  much lower to what we have experienced over the past two years, 2017-2018 the increase prices on Waste was  much, much higher. And then we clearly have some negative effect on some land fields getting exhausted over  the period.

With  regards to the asset side, let's say we are starting to see the first signs of slow macro environment improvement,  and we will see it in further detail when we look at customer loans, which have been pretty much flat. The growth  you see here is primarily driven by some timing difference on the management of our liquidity and on our  brokerage business, and capital services generated some [ph] surface (16:57) funds at quarter-end, which  disappeared soon in the second quarter and as we paid down the ECB exposure."

So we confirm our intention to use this important asset provisioning and is the starting point of our  strategy. So, we expect to have an immediate reduction on NPE [ph] map (00:09:56) but to create the condition to  work on gross NPE. And thanks also to the second P&Ls. So, bad loan disposal potentially also using the  securitization with GACS.

Overall, divisional EBITDA in the first quarter 2012 was equal to \u20ac450 million declining by  \u20ac118 million or about 21% versus the first quarter of 2011. This was mainly the result of a decrease in the  generation margin of \u20ac81 million, mainly caused by lower hydro volumes and lower clean spark spreads partially  compensated for by higher margins on coal thanks to higher output equal to 3 terawatt hours.  This has been partially compensated for by the positive results in trading and gas margin and a decline of other  items of \u20ac80 million in which the positive contribution of the ancillary service has been more than offset by some  positive non-recurring items which affected the first quarter, 2011."

In any case, if we  adjust demand by temperature and working days, the reduction in Italy and Spain would be 3.1% and 3.5%,  respectively. In both countries, electricity demand continues to be affected by lower industrial output and the  contraction of GDP, which we estimate in the first quarter 2013 at minus 2.1% in Italy and minus 1.9% in Spain."

Without taking into  accounts this one-off negative effects, EBITDA would have been in line with the first half of 2010. Russia  increased by \u20ac62 million with generation activities contributing \u20ac43 million and supply activities contributing \u20ac19  million, mainly thanks to higher volumes.  Before analyzing the remaining divisions, I would like to address your attention to our Russian generation  activities on slide number 14. OGK-5 reported first half 2011 EBITDA of about \u20ac177 million or 40% up versus last  year. This was mainly due to increasing power prices on the free market and higher capacity payments."

However, in Italy, we recorded an  increase of 32 million euro in Enel.si, our franchise in business units thanks to higher volumes on  sales of photovoltaic solar panels which is really booming. An increase of 52 million euro in Iberia  and Latin America mainly attributable to the consolidation of this year in the second quarter 2010  which has offset the fall in Spanish power prices and the lower hydro production in Panama due to  the El Ni\u00f1o effects."

In the first nine months of 2017, thanks to our  geographical diversification, we were able to maintain a stable EBITDA, net of one-off and perimeter, despite  adverse conditions in Iberia, but improved debt. In particular, the strong performance in Italy led by a double-digit  growth in retail and in LatAm, thanks to CapEx-driven growth and higher distribution tariffs offset the poor  performance in Iberia. In the last 12 months, we have increased the pace of our industrial growth, in particular, in  renewables, adding 2.3 gigawatts of additional capacity. In the next quarter, we expect to add further 1.2  gigawatts of additional renewable capacity that will further accelerate growth EBITDA contribution. The group net  ordinary income, net of one-offs, recorded an increase of plus 3%, thanks to our ongoing debt optimization  strategy and lower minorities, in line with our strong focus on the bottom line."

Starting with the relevant market  drivers, we\u2019ve seen a steady recovery in the energy demand in 2010 after the drop in 2009. As for  the future, we expect demand for gas and power to both grow at a steady rate of 1/2% per year.  Within this scenario, the Italian generation mix is characterized by the use of expensive  technologies with no nuclear and limited coal presence. Since 2000, about 30 gigawatts of new  CCGT have been built in Italy and in total, it accounts for about 50% of the Italian production.

These targets will be achieved by leveraging on our consolidating know-how;  supply; improving the offer of value-added product and services; and reinforcing our commitment to  client quality perception."

We expect to sell in the Mainland liberalized market, you  can see on the chart, around 75 terawatt hours in 2011 and 81 terawatt hours in 2015. Our own  production share will increase from 59%, as you can see, in 2011 to some 67% in 2015. This is  also due to the fact that in 2011 we do not include in this percentage our production out of domestic  coal because with the Royal Decree as a matter of fact it is now for a number of years a regulated  activity. Our strategy together with our high quality asset mix and commercial capabilities will  continue to create value through margin optimization and stabilization."

You can appreciate that Endesa within this very promising region is brilliantly positioned,  thanks to a Tier 1 country profile in terms of GDP, expected growth, country risk in terms of rating.  GDP forecast for 2011 are very encouraging, reaching levels of around 5% growth in all countries  where Endesa operates. In the same vein, the country risk measured by Standard and Poor\u2019s show  that Chile, Brazil, Columbia and Peru have a lower level of risk than the average in the region and  their ratings range from BBB minus to A plus in Chile.

As for the technical profitability of the non-life business, the combined ratio improved by 0.7 points as a  result of the favorable evolution of the loss ratio, while the expense ratio is basically stable. With reference to our  main countries, in Italy, the combined ratio went down 1.2 points, thanks to the improvement of both loss ratio  and expense ratio. The decrease by 0.6 points of the loss ratio is fully attributable to the motor segment, where the  current year loss ratio benefits from both lower claim frequency and the increase of the average premium.

Big contribution of the other M&A, I'm  referring to the distribution of LPG in Sardinia and the energy efficiency in respect of course to the first quarter of  2018. If we sum up all the contribution of the M&A activities present in the first quarter of 2019 and not present or  partially present in the first quarter of 2018, some of the revenues in the first quarter of 2018 are equal with \u20ac10.5  million, excluding Enerco and Amalfitana that were fully merged already in Italgas."

If we take a look at the unit cost, our unit cost has been \u20ac113. As you  know, regulation recognized for each meter installed \u20ac142. So, the \u20ac29 difference, 60%, that is \u20ac70 will benefit the  system, the remaining nearly \u20ac12 per unit will benefit Italgas. The good news is that at the end of June, we almost  reached the requirement set by the Italian regulator. As you know, the requirement is to replace 100% of the large  meters, already done, and 50% of the residential ones. The target was set for the end of 2018. As of June, we  nearly reached the target.

Built with extremely advanced single- barrel production process and incorporating the new carbon fiber material, representing a step change for the  industry. We believe that in the long-term the B787 also with the new version B787-9 will be profitable for us and  we can also apply the knowhow to other new generation planes. In the regional turboprop and regional jet  segment, a new initiative will depend not only on an adequate return on capital but also in technological,  industrial benefit, which we could exert. We will define our strategy in this segment by the end of 2012."

At the bottom of the  page, you have a box, where we have listed the main effects explaining this increase. The first  important effect is the much higher metal prices that we had in the first quarter compared to year  end. We had approximately a \u20ac800 per tonne increase in the copper price. We have approximately  60,000 tonnes of working capital within \u2013 of copper within our working capital. And this easily  explains this 42 million increase purely coming from higher metal prices."

Compared to December 2015, where the parameter on the other hand is absolutely the same,  because OCI was already consolidated, we had a very shape increase of \u20ac270 million, almost \u20ac270 million \u2013 \u20ac270  million exactly, which is almost 100% coming from the increase of the working capital in the Energy Projects,  which are where there will be almost completely, I would say, recovered in the second part of the year.

Power distribution, especially in  Europe is really very, very low. That's for many reasons. First of all, because of the very low level of construction  activity as I already said in other call conferences, but other than that, obviously, all the European utilities or the  major European utilities are dropping down the investments.

And certainly, for this \u2013 what I consider to be a fundamental shift and the way  in which Ferrari is going to be architecting its cars, I think we have acknowledged in the past analyst calls that the  need for us to embrace the hybrid world and I think that most of the, if not all of the vehicles that will be s old  certainly beginning with 2019 with the cycle of cars that will be launched from that point on will include by  definition hybridization. I think it's a mandatory requirement. I think that we'll make some unique in the Ferrari  world as an addition to the benefits associated with the environmental impact of using batteries, I think we'll be  using the combination of combustion and electrification to provide unique powertrain combinations that will yield  even additional performance on these vehicles. Things that we've seen already at least in embryonic stage in  Maserati, which was launched a couple of years ago."

And as far as gas,  it\u2019s a different story. Indeed now we have to talk of different stories and it\u2019s because in Europe the  market seems to be recovering while the state is still low.

And so, [inaudible] of 10  companies you will see in this industry are expected to achieve in \u201809 still very good results. So a  very slight modest decrease compared to \u201808, which as we know was a record year. So still \u201809 is \u2013  in terms of financial results for our industry still a very good year. Well, in 2010 the negative market  we\u2019ve been experiencing since Q4 \u201808 and through \u201809 will filter \u2013 will start to filter to the profit and  loss, and so the same panel of oil service companies are expected to post in 2010 a decrease, a  decrease of some 60% in terms of net income.

Now as you may recall in January we have secured contracts for these  units.

The only negative impact  affecting this segment will be some lower utilization of some conventional assets. Assets like, the  Semac, the Semac is a pipelayer for conventional water deployed in the eastern hemisphere and  definitely in 2010 this unit will enjoy a lower utilization. So the result will be probably some revenue  decrease, nothing dramatic but probably some revenue decrease compared with \u201809 and some  increase in the costs associated with the idleness of some units, particularly I was mentioned  earlier on conventional units."

In certain instances, this is acceptable.  Frequently, however, it has not being operationally reliable. Also it has appeared increasingly strategically  inappropriate. So we decided a couple years ago to develop our own large and cost effective yard in Karimun to  support both offshore and onshore projects.  As you see on the slide, we have already secured quite a reasonable initial workload. None of these ongoing  projects are for Indonesia. We are presently performing some work for Al Wasit, Gorgon, the Iraq crude export to  Liwan and Bien Dong. And Al Wasit for Saudi Arabia is a good example of the way this can work.

The European gas market is  evolving in a way that is positive for infrastructure requirements, and therefore Snam for three reasons. First,  Europe will need additional imports of natural gas going forward. Natural gas will play an increasingly important  role in European energy mix, as Europe tries to achieve its COP21 objectives and move towards a lower carbon  economy. Europe accounts for 13% of global gas consumption, but only has 1% of global reserves. And as y ou  know, domestic production is declining quite rapidly."

A remarkable increase in  electricity production 13.2 terawatt hour from renewable sources, around 2.5 bcm of gas demand, in particular  solar energy. These negative elements were only partially offset by the 8.7% decrease in hydroelectric production."

Before,  Stogit and Snam Rete Gas were run as separate entities. By putting them in the same business unit, we're able to  extract these synergies."

As mentioned earlier, we will continue our actions and launch new  initiatives. This slide gives you a summary overview of our recently launched additional actions, which shows our  continuous effort on cost containment. We have identified a number of projects, which will allow us to make  additional cost savings. We expect that this measure will create saving with the net present value of \u20ac1.8 billion,  gross of slightly more than \u20ac200 million of integration cost taken in the 4Q 2012. So net present in total \u20ac1.8  billion.  Let's move now to cost of risk. As discussed already though the presentation, we took \u20ac4.6 billion loan loss  provision in the last quarter of 2012, this in order to take in account of the difficulty of this economic climate. So  we've done a \u20ac2.1 billion additional provision on top of the normal run rate to improve the coverage in Italy. This  conservative approach to provisioning has driven up obviously the cost of risk in Italy quite considerably. This  high rate is due the factor to one-off provisioning and does not indicate a future run rate. There is an increase, as  you see also for Germany, that is explained by single large tickets and already this quarter we go back to the  normal level, about 40 to 50 basis point."

As to the third project, it's the integration of Edipower we're on page 18 of the presentation.  So you see where our plants are located from a geographical viewpoint. And we did not include only power  generation plant, but also cogeneration plants. And WTEs just to give you, as I said, a snapshot. And an idea that  all of these activities and operations are integrated with one another and with the group. We think we can have a  very well-balanced and diversified generation mix. Our combined cycles are very flexible they do not have any  constraints and in terms of take or pay contracts, very limited CapEx. This is what we foresee for the future,  because whatever we have to do in terms of repowering, we already have done and achieved, exceptionally for  projects that I will be mentioning later on for coal-fueled plant and then hydro as well will play a paramount role."

First of all,  the dispatch and service markets more than doubled in just one year time. Why is it so? Well, for the reasons that  I mentioned during my preliminary statements, because the renewable, the non-programmable ones will be added  to the market, so therefore destabilizing the market.

In June 2011, the average revenue of Edipower was at a premium compared to the base load in  Northern Italy by \u20ac4.3 per megawatt hour. One year after the premium to the average price amounted to \u20ac7 point- something. So if we compare this with the best prices, i.e., peak prices in the North Italian markets, we will see  that in 2011 the average revenue was \u20ac3.4 revenue lower per megawatt hour. In 2012 that amounted was in line  with the best prices in Northern Italy, which means that we can get the best prices that can be [indiscernible]  (00:41:05) in Northern Italy through our plans.

You  can see the two targets we wanted to achieve, efficiency gains and the organic growths along the different  business lines, along the full pipeline of energy, waste, district hearing and networks. Now the bulk will come from  energy, as you can see on the right-hand side. In addition to efficiency gains, contribution will certainly come from  EPCG, approximately \u20ac14 million.

However let's draw your attention to the years of beyond 2015. So we  have identified two major different areas in addition to the more traditional recurring ones. First of all energy as I  said earlier, the main goal will be then of reducing installed capacity from 1,000 megawatts to approximately 300  megawatts with the way higher efficiency levels. We're talking about coal fired plants with biomass and again  here, the strong note is that the contribution coming from the integration of the waste sector CapEx \u20ac450 million,  \u20ac400 million, we have included only \u20ac30 million starting from the last year with a potential EBITDA of  approximately \u20ac17 million when all the plans will be fully on stream."

One, it is something we really must respect and second, being good at these, and able to propose  sustainable products to our customers and they can propose to their consumers, we believe, we have a  competitive edge and we see some effects of this already in the FI results. The two areas we have here is the  palm oil that is sometimes associated to some of the deforestation of our rainforests. And the other area is the  shea nuts that goes into our CCF products. We are active in eight countries in Western Africa.

We've talked about this before. For a while we had this slide a little bit further in the back because  prices were more stable, but with this decrease this is going to impact our working capital positively, so we will  need to or we will have the opportunity to tie up less capital and working capital. And as we write here, we expect  a 10% change in the raw material prices to impact working capital by plus/minus SEK 250 million.

The part of the  operations of TLC and Belovo, we succeeded to get in contact with here and we have reached a management  agreement with the trustee of this situation, of BNLfood Group. And this was a small startup in the field of  nutrition, in the field of the very exciting segment of egg phospholipids which is a very, very exciting way to  produce these special lipids. And our good studies on the benefits of the phospholipids and some of these exist  today produced from tuna. But from a sustainability point of view, egg phospholipids from egg yolk has some  dramatic advantages as you all quickly can see. So, these have started well, and we see a lot of potential  applications for these really in our Akonino range and other nutritional products. So, this is another key initiative  during the fourth quarter."

Also the aerospace, where we made some plans a few years ago to further  invest in aerospace, yeah, those plans have been launched now and creating more value over time and also the  North America market we had that already in the second half of last year, especially the power generation market  is slowed down already in 2017 and that's more or less the same situation as we see today.

We really take our responsibility, but we also have an impact, especially we are impacting ecofriendly  buildings, sustainable transportation, lifetime extension of materials, clean water and sanitation and producing  and consuming responsibly. For example, we make almost or sell almost more than 300 million meters of pipe.  You can imagine when you transport water or heating through our pipes, there we have a big impact also for the  environment that we should talk more about it, because Aalberts does a lot.

Norman and the team have been working for the last four months doing the  design work on the operating model and we go live on the operating model in August. And so, the next quarter or  this quarter, in particular, will be really important to start to see that lift in the waste tonnes. The good news is,  the  waste associated with ore is in good shape and will certainly, in my view, deliver on the 35 million tonne. The real  important area now is the pre-strip, which determines how much ore exposures you'll have in years 2015-2016.

We've actually split  those up and cut them very differently, so it improves our access to ore. But very simply put, over the life of mine,  we've cut out 600 million tonnes of waste that would have been mined with no loss of ore.

Now, I'll  deal more specifically with Los Bronces in a minute. It's not simply about snowfall. We made a couple of poor  decisions in equipment selection that have impacted the outcome, but that's being corrected. And I'll just speak to  that in a second. At El Soldado, we've turned the corner. We were originally forecasting a potential $100 million  cash loss when we looked at spot prices back in December. We've adjusted the mining strategy.

And I've got to  give great credit to the work that's been done. And as I said, Grosvenor seven months early, under budget, and  continuing to improve the operation. The other point I would make in this regard is across the board, but in  particular, with Coal, we're not only improving our operating costs, we're improving our capital costs as a  consequence of the efficiencies and development and the other activities that we're driving across the business.  So our capital numbers are improving, both as a reflection of the disciplines that we're introducing in terms of  capital spends but also as a consequence of the improving productivities that we're getting from equipment.

In all of the work we've been doing in the last three years,  it's been very much about reengineering the way the business works.

So it's about efficiency, changing the way we  operate, getting 30% more out of our equipment, improving our productivities so that our cost reductions and our  cost improvements and our business improvements are long-term sustainable. We also believe that innovation is  going to play a more significant role in the way we run the business in the next 5 years to 10 years. I'm not of the  view that the industry has hit a wall on cost and efficiency improvement. In fact, I'm of the opposite view that I  think we will see a period of time in this industry where there'll be more innovation and more step changes in cost  because of what we've come through as an industry. So manufacturing-type approaches, which is reflected in our  operating model, that's an opportunity that will continue to deliver us beyond 2016, that's item two there.

So that's  one area of work that Tony with the Group executives are working on in terms of things that we can do, get a  better bang for our buck, and improve our costs. Second, and you'll see a photo of a machine that we've just put  underground at Twickenham. It hasn't started cutting yet, Chris, I don't think. But we've been doing some  technical development work with Atlas Copco on Rapid Mine Development System. So, for us, the ability to  develop more productively is about reducing our costs. And so, we think there's great potential in resources like  Amandelbult, Der Brochen, and Twickenham, those sorts of assets. That will take some time, but it's a very  different approach to what you would have seen some years back in the platinum entry.

We  believe that we can reduce our water consumption per tonne processed in the copper business in Chile by more  than 50%. Now, for those that have been tracking the Chile industry and the discussions around desalination  plants and the massive capital that's been committed to those types of projects, we think there's got to be a better  way. So, in the last 12 months in our new open technology platforms, we've been working with a range of  partners. We've identified a technology. By coarse grinding and then changing the way we float material, which is,  obviously, coarser than what you would normally do and then changing the way we process the tailings, we can  reduce our water consumption by around 50%. Now, that type of technology can be applied in copper, because  that's what we've been doing our test work on. But it can be also applied to other environments and other  processes. So it could be platinum issue, it could be Botswana. Those areas that are short of water, this is a  major step."

But it's a technology that also improves water or dewatering of products. So, ultimately, we are looking  to see if we can design mines that don't require wet tailings disposal. So, in the next couple of years, this, for us,  is a game changer in copper. Because for us, Los Bronces, Collahuasi, the size of those resources, at the  moment, are constrained by available water. If we can break that, we're already working out pilots on how we go  through the process. That, for us, is a game changer and starts to explain to you why we're keen on Copper and  why we think our assets in Copper have great potential in Mogalakwena, our diamond assets, and beyond. And  those technologies are things that I think you'll hear a lot more from us and, probably, over time, compare to this  in the industry. We may not be where we were up to at the moment, but I think these are going to be game  changers. And so, I think it's a fallacy when people say innovation and cost reductions aren't going to occur. It will  be a matter of who's quickest on the ground and how quickly they can apply those technologies to their  operations. So, main thing I want to say, we are not sitting on our bums working simply on cost reductions. It's  about efficiencies and about hitting the process and hitting our capital deployment in every way we can to create  value."

Our focus on structure and asset optimization programs has yielded significant  benefits with labor productivity at our export mines some 48% above 2008 levels. Longwall  performance at our premier hard coking coal sites, Moranbah and Capcoal, has been a particular  focus. We have embedded new longwall management processes at these site, which have driven a  50% improvement in longwall move times and a 23% increase in underground production. As a  result of these initiatives, our coking coal production is now almost entirely positioned in the lower  half of the industry cost curve."
